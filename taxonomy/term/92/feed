  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for the most dedicated local eaters, there are some harsh realities to locavorism.  By early June, the sun is warm, the earth is vibrantly green, and the garden is thriving.  But even though the time seems ripe to add thick, smooth-fleshed slices of homegrown tomato to the supper table, without the help of season extending hoop houses, we are weeks from harvesting fruiting crops. CSA members often share a common story of their enthusiasm at receiving the first several leafy green shares quickly giving way to hidden chagrin at the brimming, and seemingly endless, bags of chard, kale, lettuces, and mustards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produce seasonality follows the life-cycle of annual plants: seeds sprout, sending roots earthward searching for water and nutrients, and stems skyward seeking the sun.  Leaves unfold to collect solar energy, and once the plant has developed enough leafy surface area to fuel its exploits, the plant becomes sexually mature: flowers form, developing into fruit, packed with seeds of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So goes the locavore’s annual menu cycle: the earliest arrivals to our table are fast growing roots (e.g., radishes), stems (asparagus) and leaves.  Lots and lots of leaves.  Soon come the precocious peas, the fastest annual vegetable to produce offspring.  The slower developing roots (potatoes, carrots, beets) show up next, preceding the imminent arrival of the gods and goddesses of the vegetable patch: tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, eggplant…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s June, and while we obediently peruse the farmers market each week, waiting for the arrival of each new produce prize, all that beautiful greenery might be getting a little…dull.  But fear not! Greens add nutrition and life to many dishes, and different varieties can be interchanged in recipes with ease.  A few basics tips for your leafy green arsenal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Cooking time is the main variant in dealing with different types of leafies.  Young spring greens will cook more quickly than those available later in the summer and into the fall.  Collards and kale tend to be tougher than mustard greens, beet greens, or Swiss chard, and require slightly longer cooking times.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Stems of all leafy greens are edible, though they are often discarded due to their tougher texture.  To even the score, strip leaves from their stems, chop the stems fine, and start cooking them in advance of the leaves—throw them in with the onions and garlic, adding the leaves later.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Substitute Swiss chard in any recipe calling for cooked spinach.  Its flavor is almost identical, and it doesn’t reduce in the heat as much as spinach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond grandma’s cooked-all-day greens (and resolving to retain at least a smidge of their nutrition), greens can be added to soups, stirfries, curries, and pastas with reckless abandon, or used to make creative side and main dishes that stand on their own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Marry sweet, savory, and vegetal flavors with an Italian chard sauté: Sauté onions and chopped chard stems in olive oil (or if you’re feeling naughty, bacon fat) until softened.  Add torn chard leaves, working in batches if needed and cook until wilted.  Add a handful or raisins and a splash of water.  Cook until raisins are plump, season with salt and pepper, and serve sprinkled with pine nuts and a dash of balsamic vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Create a beautifully simple raw kale salad: Strip washed kale from stems and chop fine.  Drizzle with olive oil and sea salt and massage kale until it softens and turns an emerald green, savoring the smell of the chlorophyll.  Toss with a little lemon juice and serve as is or topped with freshly grated Romano cheese or nutritional yeast.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Whip up a weeknight dinner with an any-greens frittata: Sauté onions and garlic in a heavy stovetop-to-oven worthy pan, such as cast iron.  Add washed, torn greens, and cook until wilted.  Pour scrambled, seasoned eggs over greens, and top with a cheese of your choice.  Cook over low heat on the stove top until beginning to set, then transfer to the oven and bake until top is set and cheese is melted and beginning to brown.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Surprise your guests with a Swiss chard saag (Indian creamed spinach): Fill a pot with washed chard leaves, and add a cinnamon stick, some grated fresh ginger, and a chopped jalapeño, tomato, and small onion.  Cover and cook over medium heat until greens are very tender.  In a separate pan, sauté another chopped onion and some crushed garlic, then throw in generous, equal doses of ground cumin and coriander (about a tablespoon each).  Remove from heat.  Puree the greens in a blender or with an immersion blender (remember to remove the cinnamon stick), then stir in the spiced sautéed onions.  Season well with salt.  Seriously, it works!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s amazing how short our memories can be.  Perhaps it was just last year that we watched as our cucumber vines clobber their neighbors (and their neighbors&#039; neighbors).  But as May rolls around again, we tenderly set out this season&#039;s sweet seedlings, cozily tucked in tight rows with its friends.  And even though last year’s tangled mess is hiding in the shadows of our memories, it just seems impossible that this benign little guy will grow to nuisance proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in May&#039;s warm soil, you can almost see the vines growing.  Before we know it, our garden is crowded, hard to tend, and uninviting.  Trellising can make the difference between a garden that draws us in and one we want to turn our back on.  Lifting plants to great heights maximizes space, eases harvesting, improves disease-thwarting air circulation, and creates visual interest.  Strategically placed trellises can also provide privacy screening and afternoon shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants, such as peas, pole beans, and grapes, require a trellis to climb.  Trellising is optional for other natural-born climbers, such as cucumbers, winter squash, and small melons.  In a small space, your other plants will thank you for guiding these bullies up and off the ground (but you’ll have to leave the big guys, such as watermelon, safely on the earth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating trellises can be as simple or fancy as you like.  Fences can serve as de facto trellises for cucumbers and vining squash.    Lattice, leaned against a wall or fence, can serve as an instant trellis.  Sturdy bamboo poles lashed together at the top with twine can serve as teepees (also called tuteurs) for beans and peas.  Placed in beds and borders, these create beautiful focal points for your design.  Arbors are trellising structures that train plants over an archway to provide a shady respite or striking entrance to your garden.  They can be simple arches, or larger, gazebo-like structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural reclamation stores, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loadingdock.org/&quot;&gt;The Loading Dock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chesapeakerestore.org/&quot;&gt;Habitat for Humanity ReStore&lt;/a&gt;, are gold mines for trellising materials: all manner of posts, rails, stakes, and frames can be purchased for ultra cheap, placed securely in the soil next to your plants, and naturally transformed into things of beauty.   When divorced from plumbing applications, where water-tightness is the daunting factor, copper tubing is surprisingly easy to work with to create arbors.  The warm-toned metal, paired with simple connectors and some blowtorch moxy, can be used to create pretty towers on which your plants will strut their stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trellising tomatoes is of a different nature: supporting them keeps them tidy, avoids vine breakage under the weight of heavy fruit, and prevents fruit from rotting on the ground.  However, tomato vines are not inclined to grab onto and climb supports on their own.  Staking can keep things on the up and up, but requires vigilance in tying vines up to the support as they grow.  Sturdy cages (forget those wire cones) that support branches as they reach out from the vine are the best low-maintenance option.  Good garden supply stores sell heavy-gauge, collapsible, square towers for tomatoes.  These will do the job, however, they can be spendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating your own cages out of concrete remesh is a more economical option.  They don’t collapse once built, but can be left in the garden all winter when not in use.  To build remesh tomato cages, you’ll need one remesh sheet for each cage.  Four foot by seven foot remesh sheets with six inch square holes and can be purchased at home improvement stores along with tie wire (sold near the remesh).  You’ll need metal snips to cut the tie wire, and work gloves to protect your hands.  Bend remesh into a cylinder and slip the free ends of the mesh into the second column of holes in the adjoining side.  Lay the cylinder on its side with the seam side up, and use the tie wire to lash the free ends of the remesh to the wire it overlays.  Place cages over tomatoes at planting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to add some vertical whimsy (and a bit of organization) to your garden?  Urban Farmhouse offers plans and products to help get your plants up and at &#039;em.

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
410-963-2712&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: before the turn of the millennium, you may have used the word ‘local’ to differentiate between bus routes, to indicate a library branch or school, or to describe the proximity of a business.  But say the word now and your mind immediate jumps to the origin of your food.  Concern over the ecological and social implications of the source of our food have progressed from an elitist trend to a social norm—in fact, “locavore” was the Oxford American Dictionary word of the year in 2007.  Since then, we have seen a progressive expansion in the number of farmers markets and in the variety of foods available there; grocery stores regularly  highlight items from local farms, and a restaurant isn’t worth their salt if they aren’t showcasing local heirloom tomatoes on August menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our desire to procure food from friendly, familiar farmers grows, so does our interest in getting some of our food from the most local source there is: our back yards, porches, and balconies.  Growing some of your own food is a journey that nurtures an intimate connection with your food, supplements food budgets, and further informs a healthy critique of industrial farming practices.  However, the rise in interest in food gardening has re-emerged in a world that is drastically different from the nostalgic image of a 1950s backyard harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this:  in 1975, 49% of households had vegetable gardens.  This number dropped to a low in 1998, when only 24% of households grew some of their own food.  However, food gardening is back on the rise: in 2009, 37% of households had vegetable gardens, and annual consumer spending on fruit, vegetable, and herb gardening surpassed spending on ornamental flowers, shrubs, and trees.  While this is encouraging, we can’t ignore how lifestyles have changed in the last 35 years: in 1975, only 33% of households with children had two working adults, compared to 58% in 2009.  Vegetable gardens are re-emerging into a world that has less time to dedicate to gardening, and are being tended by folks who may not have grown up with a garden to learn from.  Add to that the tough economic times, and the pressure to make sure the time and space dedicated to the garden yields output is higher than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fortunate to work as a gardening and food educator in Baltimore City for the past six years, developing gardens, teaching cooking skills, and promoting good nutrition in schools, recreation centers, and senior centers throughout the area.  In my work in the community, I have thrilled at the enthusiasm of those who have discovered the allure of homegrown food, and cringed when they excitedly tell me they planted their beans in March.  I’ve marveled at the beautiful tomatoes that proud new gardeners have shown me, but longed that they might also grow carrots, okra, and sweet potatoes.  From these interactions and experiences, Urban Farmhouse was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Farmhouse (UF) is dedicated to helping homeowners and small businesses plan, install, maintain, and prepare healthy fruits, vegetables, and herbs on urban and suburban properties.  Through consultation, planning, installation, and maintenance, UF helps folks make the most of their gardening efforts, and reap all of the delicious rewards, so that they might continue to garden for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Urban Farmhouse uses a different service model than traditional landscaping outfits: typical UF clients want to connect with the gardening process; therefore, they DON’T want someone to show up, plant the garden, and disappear (although we’ll do that if you want).  Our clients want to learn and grow with their plants; we work to fill in the knowledge and skill gaps to help them be successful.  As such, our services are based around client education, and creating custom service packages that provide the clients with what the information and services they need while still allowing them the freedom to engage in the great gardening experiment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic consultations include a visit to your property, a soil test, advice on the best place to locate your garden, and a follow up summary of the best plants for your site.  Clients can then choose to purchase a custom garden plan, which includes a garden design, a three-season planting plan, a calendar of gardening tasks, and a narrative describing the whole process.  Many of our clients take it from there, while others discover that they’d rather have us install their garden.  If needed, we return for garden coaching sessions, or we provide season-long maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to be making regular contributions to CompletelyEco.com.  Each month I’ll share information and tips that will help you grow as a gardener and a local eater.  In the meantime, start thinking about your spring garden…and if you find yourself wondering how far to space your radish seeds, the best way to trellis peas, or when to plant your eggplant, contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; to schedule a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: Urban Farmhouse operates from Chrissa Carlson&#039;s home in Waverly, where she lovingly tends her blueberries, radishes, sweet potatoes, grapes, and cabbages (just to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;
