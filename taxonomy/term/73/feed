 <title>Welcome to the Urban Farmhouse!</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/welcome-urban-farmhouse</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
410-963-2712&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: before the turn of the millennium, you may have used the word ‘local’ to differentiate between bus routes, to indicate a library branch or school, or to describe the proximity of a business.  But say the word now and your mind immediate jumps to the origin of your food.  Concern over the ecological and social implications of the source of our food have progressed from an elitist trend to a social norm—in fact, “locavore” was the Oxford American Dictionary word of the year in 2007.  Since then, we have seen a progressive expansion in the number of farmers markets and in the variety of foods available there; grocery stores regularly  highlight items from local farms, and a restaurant isn’t worth their salt if they aren’t showcasing local heirloom tomatoes on August menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our desire to procure food from friendly, familiar farmers grows, so does our interest in getting some of our food from the most local source there is: our back yards, porches, and balconies.  Growing some of your own food is a journey that nurtures an intimate connection with your food, supplements food budgets, and further informs a healthy critique of industrial farming practices.  However, the rise in interest in food gardening has re-emerged in a world that is drastically different from the nostalgic image of a 1950s backyard harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this:  in 1975, 49% of households had vegetable gardens.  This number dropped to a low in 1998, when only 24% of households grew some of their own food.  However, food gardening is back on the rise: in 2009, 37% of households had vegetable gardens, and annual consumer spending on fruit, vegetable, and herb gardening surpassed spending on ornamental flowers, shrubs, and trees.  While this is encouraging, we can’t ignore how lifestyles have changed in the last 35 years: in 1975, only 33% of households with children had two working adults, compared to 58% in 2009.  Vegetable gardens are re-emerging into a world that has less time to dedicate to gardening, and are being tended by folks who may not have grown up with a garden to learn from.  Add to that the tough economic times, and the pressure to make sure the time and space dedicated to the garden yields output is higher than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fortunate to work as a gardening and food educator in Baltimore City for the past six years, developing gardens, teaching cooking skills, and promoting good nutrition in schools, recreation centers, and senior centers throughout the area.  In my work in the community, I have thrilled at the enthusiasm of those who have discovered the allure of homegrown food, and cringed when they excitedly tell me they planted their beans in March.  I’ve marveled at the beautiful tomatoes that proud new gardeners have shown me, but longed that they might also grow carrots, okra, and sweet potatoes.  From these interactions and experiences, Urban Farmhouse was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Farmhouse (UF) is dedicated to helping homeowners and small businesses plan, install, maintain, and prepare healthy fruits, vegetables, and herbs on urban and suburban properties.  Through consultation, planning, installation, and maintenance, UF helps folks make the most of their gardening efforts, and reap all of the delicious rewards, so that they might continue to garden for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Urban Farmhouse uses a different service model than traditional landscaping outfits: typical UF clients want to connect with the gardening process; therefore, they DON’T want someone to show up, plant the garden, and disappear (although we’ll do that if you want).  Our clients want to learn and grow with their plants; we work to fill in the knowledge and skill gaps to help them be successful.  As such, our services are based around client education, and creating custom service packages that provide the clients with what the information and services they need while still allowing them the freedom to engage in the great gardening experiment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic consultations include a visit to your property, a soil test, advice on the best place to locate your garden, and a follow up summary of the best plants for your site.  Clients can then choose to purchase a custom garden plan, which includes a garden design, a three-season planting plan, a calendar of gardening tasks, and a narrative describing the whole process.  Many of our clients take it from there, while others discover that they’d rather have us install their garden.  If needed, we return for garden coaching sessions, or we provide season-long maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to be making regular contributions to CompletelyEco.com.  Each month I’ll share information and tips that will help you grow as a gardener and a local eater.  In the meantime, start thinking about your spring garden…and if you find yourself wondering how far to space your radish seeds, the best way to trellis peas, or when to plant your eggplant, contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; to schedule a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: Urban Farmhouse operates from Chrissa Carlson&#039;s home in Waverly, where she lovingly tends her blueberries, radishes, sweet potatoes, grapes, and cabbages (just to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my last post, I recently made my first outing outside the good ol’ U. S. of A. I spent two weeks in Europe with my boyfriend Patrick and had the opportunity to visit some of the world’s most iconic cities: Paris, Zurich, Venice, and Amsterdam. Of course life on the other side of the Atlantic, while in many ways very similar to that in America, has quite a few differences. One of the biggest differences I noticed is the healthiness of the lifestyle. Europeans in general go shopping more often so that they can buy fresh produce instead of stock up on processed junk that can sit on the shelves for months. But, the most obvious difference is how Europeans get around: namely, biking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in biking as a means of commuting (not just as a sport) since I read “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/baltimore/shifting-gears/Content?oid=1423195&quot;&gt;Shifting Gears&lt;/a&gt;” in June 2011’s issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Urbanite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While Baltimoreans are making progress in cycling—the number of people who travel to work on their bikes went up 75 percent from 2000 to 2008—the city itself still has a ways to go in making bikers feel safer and more welcome. The city only has 42 miles of biking lanes, a paltry figure when you realize that Charm City has roughly 2,000 miles of roadway. This means that only two percent of Baltimore streets are safe for bike riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, as someone who has spent the last four years in a city where cycling commuters are a vast minority, and the previous eighteen in a medium-sized rural town without a single designated bike lane, I was absolutely amazed by the number of people utilizing the copious bike lanes in Eindhoven, the Dutch city where Patrick lives. One day while he was working and left me to my own devices, I did a bit of wandering around the city, snapping stalker-esque pictures of normal people on bikes. They were wearing jeans and boots, with handbags resting on their shoulders. They were going to work, going to the city center (where the majority of Eindhoven’s shops are), and going to the supermarket. For the Dutch, running errands on a bike is just as commonplace as doing the same in a car is for us. I do not have any statistics on bike use in Eindhoven, but I think the pictures do a good job of conveying the commonality of cycling in this beautiful small city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another highlight of my trip was an afternoon of biking in Lyon, France. Many of the larger European cities actually have areas where residents and visitors can rent bikes for up to 24 hours. These posts are all over the cities, and we were able to pick up bikes near the Saone River and ride them for a couple of hours before finally leaving them at another location by our hotel on the square. This fun feature is definitely well taken advantage of; I estimated that half of the bikers I saw in Lyon were on rented bikes. I love the idea of making biking a part of my everyday life, though I am a bit hesitant to do so in a city like Baltimore. Biking is so common in Europe because it is so easy to do. Bike lanes and rentable bikes make commuting on bicycles safe and convenient. I would love to see more U.S. cities take a cue from their counterparts on the other side of the ocean. Doing this can benefit the environment, and of course our health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You can find a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Urbanite&lt;/em&gt;’s June 2011 issue and read &quot;Shifting Gears&quot; for yourself on issuu.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
