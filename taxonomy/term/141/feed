  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;

          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto: farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As summer fades, so go the tender summer fruits.  Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant will produce until first frost, but they are slower to ripen, and the weary plants produce fruit that tells of the approaching end of the season, with thicker skins, and smaller size.  So we transition back to eating plants that thrive in cool weather--salad greens, hardy winter cooking greens, carrots, beets, turnips and radishes--but in the fall, we add to that hard veggies born in summer but maturing in fall, including winter squash, sweet potatoes, and late crop potatoes, with sturdy skins and hard flesh that have the staying power to last into winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that in eras gone by, folks lasted an entire winter on produce put up from the growing season is mystifying—surviving winter’s doldrums even without the concern of limited access to produce can be a challenge for modern sorts.  So how was winter nourishment accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canning may be the most commonly recognized method of putting up produce; canned vegetables and fruits require no refrigeration, removing one of the main limiting factors to bulk long-term storage.  However, canning is a fairly energy and equipment intensive, and food safety requires the addition of acid, salt, or sugar to most produce to prevent microbial growth—which zaps nutrition and changes the flavor of the fresh product.  Tomatoes are the ideal can-didate: with a low pH, they need no chemical modifications to stay food safe.  If you haven’t done it yet this season, can ‘em soon, and can ‘em good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more back-to-basics approach, one that might not get you through the entire winter but can keep you eating local (with occasional imported indulgences) for several months, is to cellar roots and other hard-fleshed winter vegetables.  Root cellars used to be standard issue in the outfitting of a home.  They were small rooms in the basement or built into a nearby hillside that provided hard vegetables with what they need to stay their best: darkness, constant humidity, air circulation, and cool temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your commitment to locavorism ends at the point that requires a basement renovation for inanimate winter residents, you can create similar conditions using only a large box and some sawdust or peat to insulate.  When the market is flush with them, buy a large supply of potatoes, carrots, onions, and winter squash.  If the veg is coming from your garden, harvest after a few dry days, and allow the roots to dry in the sun for a day or two.  You can rub off some of the dirt, but be careful not to nick the protective skin, and don’t wash before storage—wet skins breed rot.  Put a layer of sawdust or peat in your box, and lay down a layer of veggies, spaced close together but not touching.  Add another layer of bedding and repeat until all veggies are stored, covering with a final layer of bedding, and covering the box with a lid or flaps.  You may want to consider creating mixed veggie layers, so that retrieving a carrot doesn’t require digging through layers of potatoes, turnips, and winter squash to find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A constant temperature of around 34 degrees is ideal, but warmer is okay as long as the fluctuations are minimal—it’s the rise and fall of temperatures that signal root vegetables to break dormancy and sprout, the beginning of the end for the edibility of said root.  So place the box in the coolest place you have—the basement, the garage, the carport.  The layers of sawdust will insulate against drastic temperature fluctuations.  When you retrieve veggies for use, check for and cull any that are showing signs of rot, which can spread to others in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep your winter local diet lively, be sure you’re storing other flavors as well: now is a great time to cut and dry herbs such as rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage.  Pruning stimulates new growth, so you want to cut a few weeks before first frost to give new shoots a chance to grow and toughen up, avoiding frost damage.  While dried herbs do feel like a sorry substitute after a season of enjoying them fresh, you may be surprised at the intensity of flavor in your home-dried herbs: those purchased from commercial suppliers are of indeterminate age, and have often lost potency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you dig in to winter vegetables, use those roots and winter squash for all they’re worth: starchy, creamy flesh, when cooked soft, purees to create silky soups; their natural sugars caramelize beautifully when roasted; and shredded roots, tossed with herbs, aromatics, a beaten egg and some flour, produce wicked-good savory pancakes.  Now that doesn’t sound too much like suffering, does it?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September is a time for gardeners to luxuriate in the bounty resulting from their hard work. Sure, weeds still need weeding, and water still needs sprinkling, but much less so than in deep summer.  Spring, summer, and fall planting are done, but the time to put things to rest is still weeks away.  In the meantime, the harvest pours in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we hang in the balance between spring set up and autumn break down, take a moment to assess the season.  Look at your harvest basket.  What were your greatest returns on investment?  What would it have cost you at the grocery store?  What did you learn?  What will you do differently next year?  What varieties were highlights, and which will you gratefully trade out for something new next year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A food garden is an investment similar to a home: in the beginning, you devote a significant amount of time, money, and labor as beds are built, soil is amended, paths are laid.  After installation, inputs follow a seasonal cycle of spring investment and fall returns.  But unlike a house, whose long-term value is primarily influenced by the whims of the market, a garden’s value can continue to increase each year whilst your annual expenses decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But notice we said a garden’s value can continue to increase.  The key to ensuring your time and money remain a sound investment is to become a student of your garden. Thomas Jefferson is quoted as saying, &quot;Though an old man, I am but a young gardener.&quot; Each season is a single lesson in a lifelong curriculum.  But by taking careful notice, and yes, studious notes, we can ensure that the garden appreciates each year.  So as you savor a late summer caprese salad, make like a college freshman and take some notes: record successes and challenges, notes on varieties, pests, spacing, diseases, weeds—do it now, while the plants are at full size and telling their story (it’s so easy to forget the bad seeds in spring’s hopefulness!).  Snap a few pictures while you&#039;re at it. And--here&#039;s the key--look at your notes next winter as you plan for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a single item on your garden budget that’s always a good investment, it’s your soil.  A thriving soil ecosystem includes a diverse community of bacteria, fungi, annelids, and arthropods—your allies in transforming organic matter into nutrients your plants can use, and creating a resilient garden that doesn’t crumble under isolated disease and pest outbreaks.  As fall approaches, the natural world shifts gears from biomass production to senescence and decomposition, providing an opportunity to take advantage of this natural cycle: Fall is a great time to feed your soil; amending your soil with compost in the fall will give it time to incorporate and its nutrients to become bioavailable for spring plantings.  All that organic matter falling from the sky is also available to build your first compost pile, use as mulch, or dig into your soil to compost in place.  To learn more about fall soil stewardship, join Urban Farmhouse for a workshop at Roland Park Country School on Tuesday, October 9th at 6:30 pm.  See page three of the course catalogue for details and registration, or email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we sign off, an illustrative example: The Urban Farmhouse test garden took three seasons to establish, including beds, fruit trees and shrubs, hardscaping, composter, and a wash station, but by the fourth season, we spent only about $100 on the garden, mostly on seeds. And since late April, we&#039;ve been cooing over radishes, leeks, artichokes, tomatoes, peaches, raspberries, beets, carrots, scallions, garlic...(we could go on). From hear on out, we&#039;re in the black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one chore that can be the undoing of a garden, or even the gardener, it’s watering.  No matter what, our plants need water all season long, and often in volumes much greater than what the sky provides.  But while your plants’ thirst is a constant, there are techniques that can make your irrigation efforts more effective and less burdensome.  And by putting the water you’re using to better use, you’ll be doing our municipal water systems and the environment a favor too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardening books will tell you that vegetables need about an inch of water a week, which is useful information if you have a rain gauge or if you happen to know the exact rate that water flows out your hose.  Luckily, in the absence of that information, there is an easy way to figure out when your plants need water using your tactile intuition: Poke your finger into the soil; if it feels dry just below the surface, it’s time to water!  If it’s moist, wait a day and check again.  Roots grow deeper and stronger (a good thing, right?) if they are urged on by a little drying between waterings.  And make sure when you do water it goes where it’s needed: deep into the soil, never on the leaves, where foliar moisture can promote the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when should you execute this hydration evaluation?  Make like the early birds and water in the AM.  Watering in the morning allows water to penetrate the soil before the hot sun evaporates moisture from the surface, and allows the sun to dry any residual moisture from plant leaves.  Evening waterings are a second best, though adding moisture on a humid summer night, without the foliage-drying benefit of the rising sun, can encourage the growth and spread of fungal diseases.  Nobody likes those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to go to the effort to get that water into the ground, put out a little effort to keep it there.  Mulch keeps the soil moist between waterings.  Really, try it!—spread some straw or leaves on the surface of the soil around your veggie plants (save the wood chips for the ornamental beds), and after a dog day, compare soil moisture under the mulch to exposed areas.  You may extend the interval between waterings by a day or more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you get your water can have a big impact on your plants and the planet.  Water from the hose is okay, although the residual salts from the treatment of municipal water can eventually build up in the soil.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZMTSS4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004ZMTSS4&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=completelyeco-20&quot;&gt;Rainbarrels&lt;/a&gt; offer a solution to this problem, harvesting rainwater that would otherwise head down the storm drain to use during dry times.  However, the jury is still out on the safety of watering edibles with water that has flowed across rooftops and sat in stagnant silence, potentially picking up contaminants and breeding funk. To help you decide for yourself, contact the Home and Garden Information Center at University of Maryland Extension for more information on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to use a rain barrel, think through the installation to ensure that water is not only captured, but also used.  If it’s not easy to extract the water from the barrel, you might end up saving one barrel-full of water from the storm drain, but then never put it to use in your garden.  Build a sturdy stand to elevate the barrel three feet and you’ll have plenty of pressure to water from the barrel with a hose (or easily fill a watering can).  Alternatively, you can buy inexpensive pumps that put some oomph behind the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d rather set it and forget it, drip irrigation uses less water more effectively, and can change your relationship with your garden.  Systems are typically equipped with a timer, allowing you to turn a dial and know your plants are getting the drink they need, and freeing your hands up to tend to other garden chores.  Drip irrigation systems are not necessarily expensive; a family garden can be outfitted for less than $200.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Urban Farmhouse&lt;/a&gt; plans and installs drip irrigation systems, and works with our clients to teach them how to use and adapt their system to meet water needs in their landscapes.  Contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; to discuss your irrigation options!&lt;/p&gt;
