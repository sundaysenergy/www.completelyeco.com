  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the myriad of things you have to do this Christmas: decorating, buying presents, baking cookies, planning holiday parties, wrapping gifts, traveling to Grandmas, and fitting in religious observance; there leaves very little room to consider the holiday season’s impact on the environment.  But maybe try these sobering facts on for size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Wrapping paper and shopping bags account for 4 million tons of trash annually&lt;br /&gt;
	•	A natural tree will generate 3.1 kg of greenhouse gasses each year, and an artificial tree will generate 8.1 kg&lt;br /&gt;
	•	The 2.65 billion Christmas cards sold each year in the U.S. could fill a football field 10 stories high. If we each sent one card less, we&#039;d save 50,000 cubic yards of paper&lt;br /&gt;
	•	From Thanksgiving to New Year’s Day, household waste increases by more than 25%. Added food waste, shopping bags, packaging, wrapping paper, bows and ribbons - it all adds up to an additional 1 million tons a week to our landfills&lt;br /&gt;
	•	if every family reused just two feet of holiday ribbon, the 38,000 miles of ribbon saved could tie a bow around the entire planet&lt;br /&gt;
	•	At least 28 billion pounds of edible food are wasted each year - or over 100 pounds per person&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Half of the paper America consumes is used to wrap and decorate consumer products&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Each year, 50 million Christmas trees are purchased in the U.S. Of those, about 30 million go to the landfill&lt;br /&gt;
	•	About 40% of all battery sales occur during the holiday season&lt;br /&gt;
	•	If each family reduced holiday gasoline consumption by one gallon (about twenty miles), we&#039;d reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one million tons.&lt;br /&gt;
While these stats are staggering, and sobering, there are many actions (most of them very simple) that you can take to make the holidays less wasteful, and more joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Christmas Tree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Considered by many to be the quintessential symbol of the holidays, the Christmas tree is also a major cause of environmental concern.  Depending on the study results you consult, there is a case for either artificial or natural being better (or worse) for the environment.  No matter what route you take, there are ways to lessen the damage.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	If going the natural route, support small, organic Christmas tree farms in your area; or get a permit to cut a tree on National Forest land (thus helping with needed maintenance)&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Choose a living tree and plant it later.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Buy and decorate a potted Norfolk pine, they will make your home lovely year round&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Many communities offer free pick up for Christmas tree recycling, where they turn it into mulch to be used around the community, such as parks.  In Baltimore County the pick-up starts January 10th.  Go to: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/News/holiday_winter/treecollection.html&quot;&gt;http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/News/holiday_winter/treecollection.html&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	You can strip the needles from the branches to make potpourri, or to be used in cooking&lt;br /&gt;
	•	The needles can also be used to balance a compost heap- their acidity helps balance out alkaline components such as wood ash.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	The branches can be used to make Christmas decorations for the next year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping Paper, Cards, and Shopping Bags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tis the season… to spend a lot of money.  In fact, the average American will spend $750 on gifts for the holidays; and all those gifts need to be bagged, wrapped, tagged… Well you get the idea.  Yet for all the waste that goes into gift giving, there are some practical remedies.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Bring your own reusable shopping bags when you go shopping&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Use large paper bags from department stores to put used wrapping paper in to be recycled&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Shred used wrapping paper to be used as fun, protective lining for future gifts&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Old wrapping paper is great for cleaning windows, and leaving them streak free&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Christmas cards with fun patters can be cut into gift tags&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Use recycled gift wrap&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Reuse gift bags you’ve received and re-gift them to others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turkey, Stuffing, and Leftovers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There are only so many “leftovers sandwiches” you can eat before you give up and want to throw it all away, but here are some more fun options for the obvious leftovers, and some for the less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodnetwork.com&quot;&gt;www.foodnetwork.com&lt;/a&gt; offers a lot of recipes, from the easy to advanced, for your holiday leftovers&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Boil up bits of skin and bones with onion, garlic, herbs, and left over bits of raw veggies (such as celery and carrots) to make a stock to be used in soups and stews.  Extra points for this one as the stock can be frozen and used later&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Turn your leftovers (except for meat, fish, and dairy) into compost to be used in flower beds… or to replant that live Christmas tree! (check with your local waste management authority for rules and regulations in your area)&lt;br /&gt;
So keep the Holidays a joyous time, not a wasteful time, by following some, or all, of these helpful tips! And make this winter season, Green!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Net Zero Energy Homes, the Next Standard in Housing</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/net-zero-energy-homes-next-standard-housing</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Zero Energy Homes, commonly referred to as (NZEB’s), are the wave of the future; and now that wave has crashed on Maryland with the first Net-Zero home built in the Baltimore suburb of Cockeysville.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home is constructed mainly from concrete, has 6 inches of closed-cell spray foam insulation in the roof (meaning all the cells in the foam are completely closed, tightly packed together, and crevices filled with gas for maximum insulation capacity), PEX tubing radiant heat flooring (heated water travels through tubes installed under the floor, evenly distributing warmth), a 5 kilowatt photovoltaic solar panel system, a solar thermal hot water heater with two storage tanks, AND a propane backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home belongs to Dr. Thaw Poon, and was built with the goal of achieving Net Zero Energy use in mind.  He didn’t know if he could get it, but $0 was what he was shooting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction on the 10,776 square foot home was begun in the spring of 2009, with the whole project completed and moved into by December of the following year.  Then, less than 6 months later, Dr. Poon achieved his goal and received his first net $0 energy bill in May of 2011.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of factors went in to designing this uber energy efficient home, from the concrete, to the windows, the pitch of the roof, appliances, and of course the energy producing solar electric and solar hot water systems.&lt;br /&gt;
Greenspring Energy, located in Timonium, MD was the provider and installer of the 5kw solar electric panels, and the solar hot water system.  Sandi Formanek, the area sales manager for Greenspring in charge of that part of the project described it as a “labor of love, love and efficiency.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net zero phenomenon, has gained ground across the USA, and the rest of the world, with many agencies getting on board to promote the idea of a net zero home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada they developed the first net zero housing with the Eco Terra House in Eastman, Quebec.  Also in Canada the Net-Zero Energy Home Coalition actively promotes net-zero energy home construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the 71 story Pearl River Tower in China was opened and serves as headquarters for the Guangdong Company.  It incorporates renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, along with solar and wind energy generation.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2006 the United Kingdom it was announced that by 2016 all new construction homes will be designed as zero energy buildings.  To encourage this, an exemption from the Stamp Duty Land Tax will be implemented.  Taking more aggressive action in Whales; they are planning to implement the building of net zero homes by next year in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Going Green isn’t just a current fad,” says Sam Lichtenberg of Greenspring Energy, “it is the fullest realization of investment potential.  When you look at the big picture: implementing energy producing and energy efficiency products, you are saving your wallet and the world all at once.  I’m proud to work at Greenspring because I know I’m making a difference one project at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Paul Wittemann started a solar electric, and energy efficiency company that he named: “Greenspring Energy.”  Now four years later in 2011, that little start-up has landed on the Inc. 500 list of America’s fastest growing companies at number 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it all started….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with moving across the country to Colorado for the EcoStar Corporation, Paul Wittemann, now CEO of Greenspring Energy, decided to leave his job and start his own company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What sealed the deal for me,” explains Wittemann, “was when I called around to Baltimore/Washington area solar contractors and no one returned my calls.  That’s when I thought ‘I can do better, I have to do better.’”  From then on Wittemann set out to start a company that focused on the customer, not the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittemann started with $50,000 in savings, an “executive office” he found on Craig’s List for $500 a month in Towson, MD; and got to work getting certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spent the first 6 months in training, learning about the industry, and figuring out what brands I should offer.”  The new entrepreneur was working 6 and 7 days a week, doing everything from getting certified to creating marketing materials.  In October 2007 it all paid off with his first big month; installing 4 systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there the company grew quickly, adding a Pennsylvania branch in Reading in 2008, and in 2011 expanding down to Charlotte, North Carolina.  What started as one man in cubical, in four years has grown to 57 employees in three different branches across the mid-Atlantic… a growth of 8,700 percent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Greenspring difference….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason we have been successful is because we’re different,” said Wittemann, “we don’t just sell you a solar electric system; we become your solar partner for life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Greenspring is committed to selling only the highest quality brands, with the best warranties, and most dependable product lines.  Partnering with such distinguished names as “Schuco,” “Solar World,” and “LG” give Greenspring and its customers the confidence that comes from knowing their system was constructed with the most technologically advanced and responsible methods available on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anyone can sell a solar electric system,” said Larry Chaput, sales director of Greenspring, “we are selling an energy solution, combining solar and efficiency, specifically tailored for each customer to lessen their dependence on the utility companies and those ever increasing rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Greenspring has believed the best way to accomplish that is a “marriage” of solar electric and energy efficiency products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We create systems designed to “produce and reduce” if you will,” said Chaput, “as the most effective and environmentally friendly means of getting consumer’s utilities bills as close to $0 as possible.”&lt;br /&gt;
To do this Greenspring has put together a team of energy auditors who exist to teach customers ways they can improve their homes energy consumption; saving the owner’s money and reducing their environmental impact all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we go out to a home for a free site evaluation, we always suggest a Home Energy Audit.  It’s not enough to just start producing energy; people need to learn steps they can take to make their home more efficient as well,” says Wittemann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Difference for Consumers….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar by itself is a wise investment, but Greenspring Energy’s unique combination of solar and energy efficiency take return on investment to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With all the great tax incentives, both state and federal, available for people going solar, combined with our packages of solar and efficiency, many of our customers see their system has paid for itself in as little as 3 to 5 years,” said Wittemann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners are not the only demographic catered to by Greenspring.  Many small businesses are also taking advantage of the savings from solar.&lt;br /&gt;
“It [solar] really is the coolest thing,” says area sales manager Frank Sullivan.  “I have this guy in Baltimore who owns a Driver’s Ed school.  He wants to do a full solar array on the roof to feed to a charging station for the 2 electric cars he just bought for his students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,300 solar installs to date, and four years of experience creating custom energy solutions for its customers, Greenspring is a company you can count on to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes we have expanded and grown and that’s great,” says Wittemann. “Do I think someday we might be a nationwide company?  Maybe.  But right now we are really just focused on being the best.”  That, it would seem, is the REAL Greenspring Energy difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Buerger&lt;br /&gt;
Founder, B’more Organic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see business as part of a community. We live and work among our neighbors. We use the communities’ resources -- fire, police, and trash pick up.  We use water and sewers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses have lot of burden’s placed upon them by governments, such as taxes and regulations, and they are facing tough issues like rising health care costs. We still believe businesses can help enhance our society as part of the solution to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable companies realize that they use precious resources -- clean water, oil, and air.  We also understand that we create externalities such as air pollution, waste, and carbon emissions all of which detract from our environment.  At B’more Organic, we think its our job to minimize these aspects because we want to live on a healthy planet. After all, our children breathe the air and drink the water that we harm.  We also understand basic economics: there’s a limited supply of natural resources: coal, oil, and fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B’more Organic’s milk come from a sustainable farm that has grass-fed, organically raised cows. We think its bad to inject cows with antibiotics; feed them grain; give them hormones; or have them eat grass treated with pesticides.  It may cost more, but people have come to realize that bad health costs more in the long run.  People call that being sustainable. We think it’s good for the planet. And, we think it’s good for business. People can taste the difference, and we’re providing the consumer what they want: a product that won’t harm them, our children, or our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Spring Wood farm where we get our milk and make our smoothies, they are so progressive and help us be better citizens in the community we do business. They are solar powered so we aren’t consuming natural resources other then the sun, and do less harm to the air when we make our product.  What I love also about the farmer is that he takes great care of his animals. I’m an animal nut. (My poor husband: I make him remove insects and place them gently outside.)  And we’ve found that happier cows make better tasting milk. Are we being socially responsible in being sustainable or just good business people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously our name is a play on words: we started in Baltimore (B’more to us locals) and we want people to be a little more “organic” every day. We understand that it’s a journey. We don’t want people to feel bad for where they are now, just encourage them improve over time. Our three core values are: B’more Giving, B’more Healthy and B’more Green. If we had to pick to give one piece advice to the next generation, I would say B’more giving.  We give 10% of our proceeds to Johns Hopkins breast cancer and MS research. But B’more Giving is not just a charitable concept. It’s B’more giving of your time, and B’more Giving of yourself. The world would be just a little better if we could all be just a little more giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating our company, we chose to stick to our core values. Many people said not to be organic, or to add preservatives, add sugar for American tastes, or not be so green, don’t give so much away to charity, but in the end, people can tell the difference. And we didn’t compromise one inch. Is this sustainability? Yes, and we think it’s just about being a good neighbor, and making a community we’d want to live in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created B’more Organic protein smoothies because we felt like there was nothing on the market that met our needs. Most products had too much sugar or not enough protein. Or they weren’t organic. We wanted something conveniently bottled that we could eat and feel comfortable giving to our babies.  That’s our test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like being organic, we think sustainability is something we strive for constant improvement.   For example, we hope to find affordable bottles made from recycled plastic. These are things that can be regulated or forced upon us.  We think it makes total business sense to us because consumers appreciate what we’re doing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a sustainable company is important to us.  What good is a creating wealth for ourselves if we can’t swim in our lakes or breath our air?  But, we know you can do both: maximize profit and minimize the damage to our plant. It just takes desire and creativity.  Start by being a little more organic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the information you need to obtain your tax incentive on your electric vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;
Source: Maryland Energy Administration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mva.maryland.gov/About-MVA/INFO/27300/27300-71T.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.mva.maryland.gov/About-MVA/INFO/27300/27300-71T.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be eligible for a one-time excise tax credit, up to $2000.00, when you purchase a qualifying plug-in electric vehicle.  Effective October 1, 2010 through June 30, 2013, an individual may be entitled to receive an excise tax credit on a qualifying plug-in electric vehicle regardless of whether they own or lease the vehicle.  Business entities may also qualify for the tax credit on up to ten vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria for a qualifying plug-in electric vehicles are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be made by a manufacturer primarily for use on public streets, roads and highways.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle can not be modified from the manufacturer&#039;s specifications.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be a new vehicle purchased from a dealer or a used vehicle that was initially titled in Maryland and subsequently transferred to another Maryland owner.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be acquired for use or lease by the taxpayer, and not for resale.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The shipping weight of the vehicle may not exceed 8,500 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The maximum speed capability must be at least 55 miles per hour.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be capable of being recharged from an external source of electricity.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be propelled to a significant extent by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery that:&lt;br /&gt;
          1.  For a four-wheeled vehicle, has a capacity of not less than 4 kilowatt hours.&lt;br /&gt;
          2.  For a 2 or 3-wheeled vehicle, has a capacity of not less than 2.5 kilowatt hours.&lt;br /&gt;
If you have purchased a plug-in electric vehicle from a Maryland dealer, the dealer will assist you with completing the proper form for the tax credit.  If you purchased a new plug-in electric vehicle from an out of state dealer, or a used plug-in electric vehicle from a previous Maryland owner, you may download the form for the tax credit from our website.  From the MVA homepage, go to Forms, Vehicle Registration Forms and then scroll down to the Excise Tax Request for a Plug-in Electric Vehicle (form VR-334).&lt;br /&gt;
Fees:&lt;br /&gt;
•	There is no fee for applying for the tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also get a tax incentives for creating your own electric charging station.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the EVIP is to aid in the development of a cleaner and more efficient transportation system in Maryland.  This program will issue grants for projects in the following two categories:&lt;br /&gt;
Electric Re-Charging Infrastructure (ECI)&lt;br /&gt;
•	MEA will issue a grant/s to entities who would like to partner with our coalition in the building out of the electric re-charging station infrastructure in Maryland.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Minimum grant award: $25,000&lt;br /&gt;
Truck Stop Electrification (TSE)&lt;br /&gt;
•	MEA will issue grants for the installation of Truck Stop Electrification units at facilities within Maryland.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Grants will be issued for equipment and installation cost&lt;br /&gt;
•	Minimum grant award: $125,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Safe Bombs! </title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/safe-bombs</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else noticed how seed bombs are popping up everywhere? Seed bombs are packets or hemp bags full of seeds (obviously) holding everything from wildflowers to garden herbs in them. All you have to do is throw them around your garden or plot of grass and they should start germinating on their own. Usually what they are incased in is biodegradable with soil to start them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be cool to just go around town one day and just “bomb” your neighborhood. Then you could just sit back and watch wildflowers pop up everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can purchase seed bombs at anthropolgie.com, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrsmeyers.com&quot;&gt;www.mrsmeyers.com&lt;/a&gt; and uncommongoods.com but you can also make your own. To make your own seed bomb follow these steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed or mix of your choice&lt;br /&gt;
Dried organic compost of any kind&lt;br /&gt;
Finely Ground dry red clay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mix one part seed into three parts compost&lt;br /&gt;
2. Add five parts dry clay to the compost/seed mix and combing thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;
3. Add a little water a bit at a time until the mix becomes doughlike. You don&#039;t want it to be soggy&lt;br /&gt;
4. Roll tightly packed little balls about the size of marbles, and set them aside to dry in a shady place for a few days&lt;br /&gt;
5. To make the strongest impact distribute these balls at the rate of about 10 balls per square yard of ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed bombs don’t have to be for own enjoyment. They make great gifts too!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sustainable Living Roadshow Joins Right2Know March</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/sustainable-living-roadshow-joins-right2know-march</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Oakland, CA, July 27, 2011) - Sustainable Living Roadshow (SLR), presented by Birkenstock USA, today announced the Right2Know National Tour beginning Friday, July 29 in San Francisco, CA.  The tour will stop in fifteen cities including Salt Lake City, UT; Nelson, OH; Philadelphia, PA; Boone, NC; Saugerties, NY; Ithaca, NY; New York City; Seven Springs, PA; Washington, DC; Fairfax, VA; Asheville, NC; the US Southeast; Austin, TX and San Antonio, TX.  SLR will also stop at K-12 schools, farmer’s markets and community centers in several states. SLR will support the Right2Know March from New York City to Washington, DC from October 1 to October 16.  The Right2Know March will raise awareness about genetically modified foods and pressure the government about the lack of labeling of these foods. SLR, based in Oakland, CA, is the largest bio-fueled expedition of educators, artists and entertainers in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2005, SLR has travelled over 200,000 miles throughout the U.S., visiting festivals, conferences, colleges and community gatherings.  An “old timey carnival road show,” SLR produces fun and interactive events for people in their own backyards to inspire, inform, and educate them about their local resources, programs and ways to live more sustainably.  The thirty-person SLR crew builds totally off-the-grid scientific and educational experiences and activities such as the Solutionary Showcase to answer questions such as “What can I do at home to be more sustainable?” “How easy is it to live greener?”  “How can I use biofuel in my car?” “How do I get my kids to recycle?” “How can I grow my own food in an urban environment?” and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLR is specifically designed to raise awareness of the most relevant and important issues for American culture such as waste, renewable energy, global warming, water preservation, genetically modified foods and recycling.  Their unique philosophy of “edutainment” provides practical tools to make simple and affordable changes that can be easily integrated into everyday life. SLR believes major shifts in industry and simple lifestyle changes are required to maintain a healthy planet and learning about them should be fun, easy and unintimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLR Co-Founder and Director Zachary Carson said, “We can all make better decisions about how we live together and how we treat the environment.  SLR is a fun way of educating people about resources that are available; helping the general public make more informed decisions and lifestyle choices and promoting a shift in our national education and political systems, in an effort to improve how we live together so we can all survive and flourish.”&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Never-Ending Cleaning Product Debate</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/never-ending-cleaning-product-debate</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has his or her favorite cleaning product for one reason or another. For me I use anything by Mrs. Meyer’s for so many reasons. I trust their ingredients and their values but above that I believe their products actually clean my house and clothes. The sudsy feeling I have when I am cleaning my dishes isn’t something I get with other organic cleaning products. That isn’t to say that the amount of suds determines the ability of the product to clean but for me that is a determining factor. I also appreciate this product for their smell. Some products tend to be overwhelming but Mrs. Meyers makes me feel connected to the environment with their scents. What are your favorite cleaning products? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy Mrs. Meyer&#039;s online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrsmeyers.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.mrsmeyers.com/&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E75EQY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=completelyeco-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000E75EQY&quot;&gt;amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
