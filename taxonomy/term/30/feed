  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy of the future is here today; solar is more attainable and affordable than ever before.  There are federal, state, and local funding/ credits/ and incentives available, not to mention improved panel efficiency, and production practices that have brought the price of solar down to less than 1% of what it was back in the 1970’s when it first hit the main stream market.&lt;br /&gt;
However, even with all of the advancements and monies available, many homeowners are still unable to stomach the large up-front cost of installing their solar electric system, and have instead turned to the newest program on the block: the power purchase agreement (PPA) or solar lease.  Both programs are very similar, but with distinct differences:&lt;br /&gt;
A power purchase agreement (PPA) means that you pay a fixed rate for the electricity your panels produce.  You only pay for the electricity your system produces each month, as opposed to a solar lease where you pay a fixed amount every month for your solar panels, regardless of how much energy those panels produce.&lt;br /&gt;
So what does this mean?  Each company is set up slightly differently, but here are the basics&lt;br /&gt;
	•	You don’t own the equipment so you don’t have to pay for it, its installation, monitoring, or repairs, and depending on the terms of the lease, have little to no up-front costs.  It is similar to renting an apartment: you pay a monthly fee to live there, but don’t have to worry about a large upfront down payment, and when something goes wrong the land lord is there to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Depending on the company you go with for your project, at the end of your leases duration some companies give you the options to purchase your system at FMV (fair market value).&lt;br /&gt;
	•	If you sell your home it is easy to transfer  the lease to the new owners&lt;br /&gt;
Leasing and PPA agencies partner with local, trusted installers with proven reputations and ability.  In the Mid-Atlantic area, &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenspringenergy.com&quot;&gt;Greenspring Energy&lt;/a&gt; is one of those trusted installers, which has partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sunrunhome.com&quot;&gt;SunRun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.sunpowercorp.com&quot;&gt;SunPower&lt;/a&gt; (NJ only).&lt;br /&gt;
With so many payment and financing options available, solar is worth another look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Solar Efficiency has a “Bright” Future</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/solar-efficiency-has-%E2%80%9Cbright%E2%80%9D-future</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solar efficiency may be getting even more of a boost in the near future with the exciting new technologies being developed at Stanford University, and MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest plague to solar technology is the efficiency rate of turning solar energy into usable electricity.  Since the inception of solar photovoltaics, the industry has made leaps and bounds, advancing from an efficiency of less than 1% to upwards of 20%, and things just keep getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up north at prestigious MIT, graduate students and professors have come together to develop an online tool called: “Impurities to Efficiency” or I2E.  The program is designed to help solar cell manufacturers streamline their processes (which until now has been wholly dependent on trial and error, guided by intuition and experience) and create highly efficient solar cells, at a much faster pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor on the project, Tonio Bionassisi, is very proud of the achievements made by him and his team; confident that this new program will help streamline production, thus lowering cost, while maintaining or even improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example he shared the story of a company called “Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates,” who were recently acquired by “Applied Materials.”  Before I2E, VSEA had been producing solar panels using a long and arduous process.  Attempts to speed up production resulted in a very high sacrifice in cell performance, but by using the I2E program, VSEA “came up with a program that was about 5 times faster than the original, while performing just as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is I2E, and how does it work?  Very complicatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, when making a silicon solar cell you start with a slice of highly purified silicon crystal, which is then processed through several stages of heating and cooling.  Even though the silicon used has already been purified to 99.9999% there are still trace amounts of iron molecules, which, depending on how they are distributed in the cell, can greatly affect efficiency.  The size and distribution of these particles has the added impediment of being hard to predict, and measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where I2E comes in.  The program uses basic physics and detailed computer simulation to predict exactly how the iron atoms and particles will behave during the wafer manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Fenning, a graduate student working on the project, explained how iron particles, even the same amount, can have different effects based on their distribution through the cell with the following analogy of protesters in the city: If the protesters gather together in one intersection, they may block traffic at that point, but cars can still find their way around and there is little disruption.  “But if there is one person in the middle of every intersection, the whole city could shut down.”  Thus showing how significant this program is in the production of solar cells, allowing manufacturers to predict the most effective heating and cooling combinations to produce the most efficient cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the other side of the country at Stanford University; new technology is being developed for the harnessing of light in thin film panels.  The inspiration of which, came from an unlikely source: The US Capitol’s Statutory Hall; or more specifically its acoustic phenomenon: the whispering gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, the US Capitol’s Statutory Hall has a semi-circular domed perimeter which allows sound to be whisked around to the opposite side of the room, almost flawlessly, meaning a whisper made on one side of the room, is easily picked up on the other.  This inspired researchers to ask: if it works for sound, why not light too?&lt;br /&gt;
So Stanford Engineers set about creating tiny hollow spheres of photovoltaic nanocrystalline-silicon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nanocrystalline-silicon is a great photovoltaic material.  It has high electrical efficiency and is durable in the harsh sun,” said Stanford professor of Engineering, Shanhui Fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When set in the hollow spherical shape, the light sensitive material captures and recirculates the light, just like the whispering gallery does with sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The light gets trapped inside the nanoshells,” explained Professor of Material Science Engineering Yi Cui.  “It circulates round and round rather than passing through and this is very desirable in solar applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new structuring and production has even more benefits than just recirculating light.  The spheres are able to absorb 75% of light in important ranges of the solar spectrum.  They use 1/20th of the normal amount of material needed to produce a cell; thus weighing 1/20th the amount, and costing much less to produce.  They also are relatively indifferent to the angle of light hitting them, and are thin enough that they can bend and twist with-out damage, opening up a whole new range of possible applications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question: is there anything we CAN’T use solar for!?  Only time will tell, but right now the future looks very, very bright!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Don’t Have a Blue Christmas, Have a Green One!</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/don%E2%80%99t-have-blue-christmas-have-green-one</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the myriad of things you have to do this Christmas: decorating, buying presents, baking cookies, planning holiday parties, wrapping gifts, traveling to Grandmas, and fitting in religious observance; there leaves very little room to consider the holiday season’s impact on the environment.  But maybe try these sobering facts on for size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Wrapping paper and shopping bags account for 4 million tons of trash annually&lt;br /&gt;
	•	A natural tree will generate 3.1 kg of greenhouse gasses each year, and an artificial tree will generate 8.1 kg&lt;br /&gt;
	•	The 2.65 billion Christmas cards sold each year in the U.S. could fill a football field 10 stories high. If we each sent one card less, we&#039;d save 50,000 cubic yards of paper&lt;br /&gt;
	•	From Thanksgiving to New Year’s Day, household waste increases by more than 25%. Added food waste, shopping bags, packaging, wrapping paper, bows and ribbons - it all adds up to an additional 1 million tons a week to our landfills&lt;br /&gt;
	•	if every family reused just two feet of holiday ribbon, the 38,000 miles of ribbon saved could tie a bow around the entire planet&lt;br /&gt;
	•	At least 28 billion pounds of edible food are wasted each year - or over 100 pounds per person&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Half of the paper America consumes is used to wrap and decorate consumer products&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Each year, 50 million Christmas trees are purchased in the U.S. Of those, about 30 million go to the landfill&lt;br /&gt;
	•	About 40% of all battery sales occur during the holiday season&lt;br /&gt;
	•	If each family reduced holiday gasoline consumption by one gallon (about twenty miles), we&#039;d reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one million tons.&lt;br /&gt;
While these stats are staggering, and sobering, there are many actions (most of them very simple) that you can take to make the holidays less wasteful, and more joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Christmas Tree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Considered by many to be the quintessential symbol of the holidays, the Christmas tree is also a major cause of environmental concern.  Depending on the study results you consult, there is a case for either artificial or natural being better (or worse) for the environment.  No matter what route you take, there are ways to lessen the damage.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	If going the natural route, support small, organic Christmas tree farms in your area; or get a permit to cut a tree on National Forest land (thus helping with needed maintenance)&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Choose a living tree and plant it later.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Buy and decorate a potted Norfolk pine, they will make your home lovely year round&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Many communities offer free pick up for Christmas tree recycling, where they turn it into mulch to be used around the community, such as parks.  In Baltimore County the pick-up starts January 10th.  Go to: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/News/holiday_winter/treecollection.html&quot;&gt;http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/News/holiday_winter/treecollection.html&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	You can strip the needles from the branches to make potpourri, or to be used in cooking&lt;br /&gt;
	•	The needles can also be used to balance a compost heap- their acidity helps balance out alkaline components such as wood ash.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	The branches can be used to make Christmas decorations for the next year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping Paper, Cards, and Shopping Bags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tis the season… to spend a lot of money.  In fact, the average American will spend $750 on gifts for the holidays; and all those gifts need to be bagged, wrapped, tagged… Well you get the idea.  Yet for all the waste that goes into gift giving, there are some practical remedies.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Bring your own reusable shopping bags when you go shopping&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Use large paper bags from department stores to put used wrapping paper in to be recycled&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Shred used wrapping paper to be used as fun, protective lining for future gifts&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Old wrapping paper is great for cleaning windows, and leaving them streak free&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Christmas cards with fun patters can be cut into gift tags&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Use recycled gift wrap&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Reuse gift bags you’ve received and re-gift them to others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turkey, Stuffing, and Leftovers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There are only so many “leftovers sandwiches” you can eat before you give up and want to throw it all away, but here are some more fun options for the obvious leftovers, and some for the less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodnetwork.com&quot;&gt;www.foodnetwork.com&lt;/a&gt; offers a lot of recipes, from the easy to advanced, for your holiday leftovers&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Boil up bits of skin and bones with onion, garlic, herbs, and left over bits of raw veggies (such as celery and carrots) to make a stock to be used in soups and stews.  Extra points for this one as the stock can be frozen and used later&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Turn your leftovers (except for meat, fish, and dairy) into compost to be used in flower beds… or to replant that live Christmas tree! (check with your local waste management authority for rules and regulations in your area)&lt;br /&gt;
So keep the Holidays a joyous time, not a wasteful time, by following some, or all, of these helpful tips! And make this winter season, Green!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>How far Have We Come?</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/how-far-have-we-come</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenspring Energy has been named the 15th fastest growing company in the United States, as recorded by Inc. Magazine. To compile its annual listing, Inc. Magazine assesses companies that are privately held, independent, for profit and based in the U.S. The ranking also accounts for fiscal growth over a three-year period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its opening, Greenspring Energy has achieved a rate of growth of 8,700 percent, demonstrating that public awareness about the positive impact of solar energy, as well as the financial and environmental benefits it carries, is increasing at a rapid pace. The company has evolved steadily since 2007, growing from a team of one at launch to nearly 60 employees today, and branding itself as the premier provider of solar and efficiency products in the Mid-Atlantic region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Greenspring Energy is different because we focus on providing customized solutions for our customers that combine both solar and efficiency products,” said Paul Witteman, President and CEO of Greenspring Energy. “Our goal is to work hand-in-hand with our customers to design and install a system that is ideal based on their energy utility patterns and ultimately, what is going to give them the best and quickest return on investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operationally, Greenspring Energy has expanded is geographical service area to include much of the central east coast of the U.S., with facilities in Reading, PA and Charlotte, NC, in addition to the company’s headquarter location in Timonium, MD. The company partners with numerous reputable product manufacturers, including Schuco Solar USA, who has presented Greenspring Energy with their “National Residential Dealer of the Year Award” for the past two, consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our selection to the Inc. 500 ranking reflects the widespread acceptance of our unique combination of solar and efficiency products and services,&quot; said Wittemann. &quot;Our customers and dedicated employees have made this achievement possible. We have a lot to be proud of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Greenspring Energy will continue to focus on growth through partnering with new residential and corporate customers, while creating new program to customize and enhance solar solutions for already-existing customers.

 <title>Net Zero Energy Homes, the Next Standard in Housing</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/net-zero-energy-homes-next-standard-housing</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Zero Energy Homes, commonly referred to as (NZEB’s), are the wave of the future; and now that wave has crashed on Maryland with the first Net-Zero home built in the Baltimore suburb of Cockeysville.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home is constructed mainly from concrete, has 6 inches of closed-cell spray foam insulation in the roof (meaning all the cells in the foam are completely closed, tightly packed together, and crevices filled with gas for maximum insulation capacity), PEX tubing radiant heat flooring (heated water travels through tubes installed under the floor, evenly distributing warmth), a 5 kilowatt photovoltaic solar panel system, a solar thermal hot water heater with two storage tanks, AND a propane backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home belongs to Dr. Thaw Poon, and was built with the goal of achieving Net Zero Energy use in mind.  He didn’t know if he could get it, but $0 was what he was shooting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction on the 10,776 square foot home was begun in the spring of 2009, with the whole project completed and moved into by December of the following year.  Then, less than 6 months later, Dr. Poon achieved his goal and received his first net $0 energy bill in May of 2011.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of factors went in to designing this uber energy efficient home, from the concrete, to the windows, the pitch of the roof, appliances, and of course the energy producing solar electric and solar hot water systems.&lt;br /&gt;
Greenspring Energy, located in Timonium, MD was the provider and installer of the 5kw solar electric panels, and the solar hot water system.  Sandi Formanek, the area sales manager for Greenspring in charge of that part of the project described it as a “labor of love, love and efficiency.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net zero phenomenon, has gained ground across the USA, and the rest of the world, with many agencies getting on board to promote the idea of a net zero home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada they developed the first net zero housing with the Eco Terra House in Eastman, Quebec.  Also in Canada the Net-Zero Energy Home Coalition actively promotes net-zero energy home construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the 71 story Pearl River Tower in China was opened and serves as headquarters for the Guangdong Company.  It incorporates renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, along with solar and wind energy generation.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2006 the United Kingdom it was announced that by 2016 all new construction homes will be designed as zero energy buildings.  To encourage this, an exemption from the Stamp Duty Land Tax will be implemented.  Taking more aggressive action in Whales; they are planning to implement the building of net zero homes by next year in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Going Green isn’t just a current fad,” says Sam Lichtenberg of Greenspring Energy, “it is the fullest realization of investment potential.  When you look at the big picture: implementing energy producing and energy efficiency products, you are saving your wallet and the world all at once.  I’m proud to work at Greenspring because I know I’m making a difference one project at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Paul Wittemann started a solar electric, and energy efficiency company that he named: “Greenspring Energy.”  Now four years later in 2011, that little start-up has landed on the Inc. 500 list of America’s fastest growing companies at number 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it all started….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with moving across the country to Colorado for the EcoStar Corporation, Paul Wittemann, now CEO of Greenspring Energy, decided to leave his job and start his own company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What sealed the deal for me,” explains Wittemann, “was when I called around to Baltimore/Washington area solar contractors and no one returned my calls.  That’s when I thought ‘I can do better, I have to do better.’”  From then on Wittemann set out to start a company that focused on the customer, not the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittemann started with $50,000 in savings, an “executive office” he found on Craig’s List for $500 a month in Towson, MD; and got to work getting certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spent the first 6 months in training, learning about the industry, and figuring out what brands I should offer.”  The new entrepreneur was working 6 and 7 days a week, doing everything from getting certified to creating marketing materials.  In October 2007 it all paid off with his first big month; installing 4 systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there the company grew quickly, adding a Pennsylvania branch in Reading in 2008, and in 2011 expanding down to Charlotte, North Carolina.  What started as one man in cubical, in four years has grown to 57 employees in three different branches across the mid-Atlantic… a growth of 8,700 percent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Greenspring difference….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason we have been successful is because we’re different,” said Wittemann, “we don’t just sell you a solar electric system; we become your solar partner for life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Greenspring is committed to selling only the highest quality brands, with the best warranties, and most dependable product lines.  Partnering with such distinguished names as “Schuco,” “Solar World,” and “LG” give Greenspring and its customers the confidence that comes from knowing their system was constructed with the most technologically advanced and responsible methods available on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anyone can sell a solar electric system,” said Larry Chaput, sales director of Greenspring, “we are selling an energy solution, combining solar and efficiency, specifically tailored for each customer to lessen their dependence on the utility companies and those ever increasing rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Greenspring has believed the best way to accomplish that is a “marriage” of solar electric and energy efficiency products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We create systems designed to “produce and reduce” if you will,” said Chaput, “as the most effective and environmentally friendly means of getting consumer’s utilities bills as close to $0 as possible.”&lt;br /&gt;
To do this Greenspring has put together a team of energy auditors who exist to teach customers ways they can improve their homes energy consumption; saving the owner’s money and reducing their environmental impact all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we go out to a home for a free site evaluation, we always suggest a Home Energy Audit.  It’s not enough to just start producing energy; people need to learn steps they can take to make their home more efficient as well,” says Wittemann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Difference for Consumers….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar by itself is a wise investment, but Greenspring Energy’s unique combination of solar and energy efficiency take return on investment to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With all the great tax incentives, both state and federal, available for people going solar, combined with our packages of solar and efficiency, many of our customers see their system has paid for itself in as little as 3 to 5 years,” said Wittemann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners are not the only demographic catered to by Greenspring.  Many small businesses are also taking advantage of the savings from solar.&lt;br /&gt;
“It [solar] really is the coolest thing,” says area sales manager Frank Sullivan.  “I have this guy in Baltimore who owns a Driver’s Ed school.  He wants to do a full solar array on the roof to feed to a charging station for the 2 electric cars he just bought for his students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,300 solar installs to date, and four years of experience creating custom energy solutions for its customers, Greenspring is a company you can count on to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes we have expanded and grown and that’s great,” says Wittemann. “Do I think someday we might be a nationwide company?  Maybe.  But right now we are really just focused on being the best.”  That, it would seem, is the REAL Greenspring Energy difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
