  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the information you need to obtain your tax incentive on your electric vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;
Source: Maryland Energy Administration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mva.maryland.gov/About-MVA/INFO/27300/27300-71T.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.mva.maryland.gov/About-MVA/INFO/27300/27300-71T.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be eligible for a one-time excise tax credit, up to $2000.00, when you purchase a qualifying plug-in electric vehicle.  Effective October 1, 2010 through June 30, 2013, an individual may be entitled to receive an excise tax credit on a qualifying plug-in electric vehicle regardless of whether they own or lease the vehicle.  Business entities may also qualify for the tax credit on up to ten vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria for a qualifying plug-in electric vehicles are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be made by a manufacturer primarily for use on public streets, roads and highways.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle can not be modified from the manufacturer&#039;s specifications.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be a new vehicle purchased from a dealer or a used vehicle that was initially titled in Maryland and subsequently transferred to another Maryland owner.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be acquired for use or lease by the taxpayer, and not for resale.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The shipping weight of the vehicle may not exceed 8,500 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The maximum speed capability must be at least 55 miles per hour.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be capable of being recharged from an external source of electricity.&lt;br /&gt;
•	The vehicle must be propelled to a significant extent by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery that:&lt;br /&gt;
          1.  For a four-wheeled vehicle, has a capacity of not less than 4 kilowatt hours.&lt;br /&gt;
          2.  For a 2 or 3-wheeled vehicle, has a capacity of not less than 2.5 kilowatt hours.&lt;br /&gt;
If you have purchased a plug-in electric vehicle from a Maryland dealer, the dealer will assist you with completing the proper form for the tax credit.  If you purchased a new plug-in electric vehicle from an out of state dealer, or a used plug-in electric vehicle from a previous Maryland owner, you may download the form for the tax credit from our website.  From the MVA homepage, go to Forms, Vehicle Registration Forms and then scroll down to the Excise Tax Request for a Plug-in Electric Vehicle (form VR-334).&lt;br /&gt;
Fees:&lt;br /&gt;
•	There is no fee for applying for the tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;
