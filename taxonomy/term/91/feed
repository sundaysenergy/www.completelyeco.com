  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer brings vacations, backyard barbeques, and impromptu visits on the porch.  But it also brings guests to the garden.  After a promising spring, things can get creepy as insects descend on our carefully tended leaves, roots, and fruit.  As the temperatures spike, pests take advantage of stressed plants and ample habitat to wreck your botanical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait!  Before we get down to buggy business, we’d like to let you know that Urban Farmhouse is on a tour de farmers markets to visit with you, share garden know-how, and sell fall seedlings and our organic Bug Brew!  We love a challenge, so bring your worst pest laments to:&lt;br /&gt;
	•	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mt-Washington-Farmers-Market/180538972002740&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Mt. Washington Farmers Market&lt;/a&gt; on July 25th&lt;br /&gt;
	•	&lt;a href=&quot;http://hamiltonlauravillemainstreet.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Lauraville Farmers Market&lt;/a&gt; on July 31st&lt;br /&gt;
	•	&lt;a href=&quot;http://druidhillpark.org/Farmers__Market_5XF6.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Druid Hill Park Farmers Market&lt;/a&gt; on August 22nd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like our own health, caring for our plants’ health can take two forms: prevention and intervention.  Preventing pest problems using good planning and cultural practices should be your primary strategy.  Interventions, particularly of the chemical variety, should be executed with care to avoid taking out the good guys (beneficial pollinators and pest-predators) along with the bad guys, not to mentioned poisoning your plants and polluting your soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you make your garden less palatable to pests?  Here’s an ounce (or so) of prevention:&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Recruit help.  Beneficial insects, such as ladybug larvae, lacewings, and parasitoid wasps can get a pest problem under control before you even know it started.  Beneficials often include nectar as part of their diet, so planting a buffet of zinnias, cosmos, and sweet alyssum can welcome them home.  Letting herbs such as mint, dill, and cilantro bloom can also attract beneficials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see evidence of beneficial insects at work on a pest infestation, let them do their work!  Adding your own pesticides to the effort may kill some of the pests, but it will cut off the predator’s food supply and not allow their populations to grow, preventing further infestations.  Check out the gross awesomeness of a parasitized tomato hornworm below: those protuberances are larvae that eventually did in that hornworm, and then emerged to ensure further infestations never took hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Become a master of disguise.  Herbs, such as basil, oregano, and dill, can mask the sweet smell of your tender crops, and keep those pests away.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Keep your garden well-weeded.  Besides stealing water, nutrients, and sun from your on-purpose plants, weeds provide additional habitat for buggies.  A crowded garden also has limited airflow, setting up the perfect conditions for the development and spread of disease.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Avoid over fertilizing, particularly too much nitrogen.  Nitrogen stimulates leaf production, and while it can be thrilling to see your plants spring to life after a dose, those tender young shoots are gourmet fare for insect pests.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Manage water to avoid plant stress.  Soil should dry at the surface between waterings to avoid wet feet and encourage deep roots, but don’t let your soil dry down deeper than that.  Water-stressed plants are more susceptible to pest infestations, and are less productive in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of your best efforts, you will still have unwelcome visitors.  Expect to have at least one of your crops fail per year—learn what went wrong and start fresh next year.  But should the unthinkable occur, here are some low-impact strategies for getting the problem under control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Spa treatments: Soaps, oil, and extracts.  Insecticidal soaps, horticultural oil, and products containing botanical extracts are effective against many different types of pests.  These sprays are available at most garden centers and don’t kill off beneficial insects.  They must make contact with the pest in order to kill them, so be sure to coat all leaf surfaces, including the undersides of leaves.  Urban Farmhouse offers an organic Bug Brew, made with castile soap and extracts of our own organic garlic and chili peppers, that is effective in thwarting attacks of aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Blast ‘em off.  In general, water goes on the soil, not the leaves, to get it where it is needed most and avoid disease-ready wet leaves.  However, early infestations of aphids can be checked by a hose blast.  Repeat for a few days and reassess the need for further intervention.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Know when to wave the white flag. Pick and dispose of heavily infested plant parts (in the trash, not the compost pile).  Wash your hands afterwards to avoid spreading eggs and disease to other plants.  And while it is never easy, it is sometimes better to sacrifice a heavily infested plant for the benefit of the team: better to lose one than the whole farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Farmhouse is available for garden coaching sessions to help you troubleshoot pest issues and keep your garden productive through the dog days.  Contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; to schedule a coaching session or to purchase our Bug Brew.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for the most dedicated local eaters, there are some harsh realities to locavorism.  By early June, the sun is warm, the earth is vibrantly green, and the garden is thriving.  But even though the time seems ripe to add thick, smooth-fleshed slices of homegrown tomato to the supper table, without the help of season extending hoop houses, we are weeks from harvesting fruiting crops. CSA members often share a common story of their enthusiasm at receiving the first several leafy green shares quickly giving way to hidden chagrin at the brimming, and seemingly endless, bags of chard, kale, lettuces, and mustards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produce seasonality follows the life-cycle of annual plants: seeds sprout, sending roots earthward searching for water and nutrients, and stems skyward seeking the sun.  Leaves unfold to collect solar energy, and once the plant has developed enough leafy surface area to fuel its exploits, the plant becomes sexually mature: flowers form, developing into fruit, packed with seeds of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So goes the locavore’s annual menu cycle: the earliest arrivals to our table are fast growing roots (e.g., radishes), stems (asparagus) and leaves.  Lots and lots of leaves.  Soon come the precocious peas, the fastest annual vegetable to produce offspring.  The slower developing roots (potatoes, carrots, beets) show up next, preceding the imminent arrival of the gods and goddesses of the vegetable patch: tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, eggplant…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s June, and while we obediently peruse the farmers market each week, waiting for the arrival of each new produce prize, all that beautiful greenery might be getting a little…dull.  But fear not! Greens add nutrition and life to many dishes, and different varieties can be interchanged in recipes with ease.  A few basics tips for your leafy green arsenal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Cooking time is the main variant in dealing with different types of leafies.  Young spring greens will cook more quickly than those available later in the summer and into the fall.  Collards and kale tend to be tougher than mustard greens, beet greens, or Swiss chard, and require slightly longer cooking times.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Stems of all leafy greens are edible, though they are often discarded due to their tougher texture.  To even the score, strip leaves from their stems, chop the stems fine, and start cooking them in advance of the leaves—throw them in with the onions and garlic, adding the leaves later.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Substitute Swiss chard in any recipe calling for cooked spinach.  Its flavor is almost identical, and it doesn’t reduce in the heat as much as spinach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond grandma’s cooked-all-day greens (and resolving to retain at least a smidge of their nutrition), greens can be added to soups, stirfries, curries, and pastas with reckless abandon, or used to make creative side and main dishes that stand on their own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Marry sweet, savory, and vegetal flavors with an Italian chard sauté: Sauté onions and chopped chard stems in olive oil (or if you’re feeling naughty, bacon fat) until softened.  Add torn chard leaves, working in batches if needed and cook until wilted.  Add a handful or raisins and a splash of water.  Cook until raisins are plump, season with salt and pepper, and serve sprinkled with pine nuts and a dash of balsamic vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Create a beautifully simple raw kale salad: Strip washed kale from stems and chop fine.  Drizzle with olive oil and sea salt and massage kale until it softens and turns an emerald green, savoring the smell of the chlorophyll.  Toss with a little lemon juice and serve as is or topped with freshly grated Romano cheese or nutritional yeast.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Whip up a weeknight dinner with an any-greens frittata: Sauté onions and garlic in a heavy stovetop-to-oven worthy pan, such as cast iron.  Add washed, torn greens, and cook until wilted.  Pour scrambled, seasoned eggs over greens, and top with a cheese of your choice.  Cook over low heat on the stove top until beginning to set, then transfer to the oven and bake until top is set and cheese is melted and beginning to brown.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Surprise your guests with a Swiss chard saag (Indian creamed spinach): Fill a pot with washed chard leaves, and add a cinnamon stick, some grated fresh ginger, and a chopped jalapeño, tomato, and small onion.  Cover and cook over medium heat until greens are very tender.  In a separate pan, sauté another chopped onion and some crushed garlic, then throw in generous, equal doses of ground cumin and coriander (about a tablespoon each).  Remove from heat.  Puree the greens in a blender or with an immersion blender (remember to remove the cinnamon stick), then stir in the spiced sautéed onions.  Season well with salt.  Seriously, it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s amazing how short our memories can be.  Perhaps it was just last year that we watched as our cucumber vines clobber their neighbors (and their neighbors&#039; neighbors).  But as May rolls around again, we tenderly set out this season&#039;s sweet seedlings, cozily tucked in tight rows with its friends.  And even though last year’s tangled mess is hiding in the shadows of our memories, it just seems impossible that this benign little guy will grow to nuisance proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in May&#039;s warm soil, you can almost see the vines growing.  Before we know it, our garden is crowded, hard to tend, and uninviting.  Trellising can make the difference between a garden that draws us in and one we want to turn our back on.  Lifting plants to great heights maximizes space, eases harvesting, improves disease-thwarting air circulation, and creates visual interest.  Strategically placed trellises can also provide privacy screening and afternoon shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants, such as peas, pole beans, and grapes, require a trellis to climb.  Trellising is optional for other natural-born climbers, such as cucumbers, winter squash, and small melons.  In a small space, your other plants will thank you for guiding these bullies up and off the ground (but you’ll have to leave the big guys, such as watermelon, safely on the earth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating trellises can be as simple or fancy as you like.  Fences can serve as de facto trellises for cucumbers and vining squash.    Lattice, leaned against a wall or fence, can serve as an instant trellis.  Sturdy bamboo poles lashed together at the top with twine can serve as teepees (also called tuteurs) for beans and peas.  Placed in beds and borders, these create beautiful focal points for your design.  Arbors are trellising structures that train plants over an archway to provide a shady respite or striking entrance to your garden.  They can be simple arches, or larger, gazebo-like structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural reclamation stores, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loadingdock.org/&quot;&gt;The Loading Dock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chesapeakerestore.org/&quot;&gt;Habitat for Humanity ReStore&lt;/a&gt;, are gold mines for trellising materials: all manner of posts, rails, stakes, and frames can be purchased for ultra cheap, placed securely in the soil next to your plants, and naturally transformed into things of beauty.   When divorced from plumbing applications, where water-tightness is the daunting factor, copper tubing is surprisingly easy to work with to create arbors.  The warm-toned metal, paired with simple connectors and some blowtorch moxy, can be used to create pretty towers on which your plants will strut their stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trellising tomatoes is of a different nature: supporting them keeps them tidy, avoids vine breakage under the weight of heavy fruit, and prevents fruit from rotting on the ground.  However, tomato vines are not inclined to grab onto and climb supports on their own.  Staking can keep things on the up and up, but requires vigilance in tying vines up to the support as they grow.  Sturdy cages (forget those wire cones) that support branches as they reach out from the vine are the best low-maintenance option.  Good garden supply stores sell heavy-gauge, collapsible, square towers for tomatoes.  These will do the job, however, they can be spendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating your own cages out of concrete remesh is a more economical option.  They don’t collapse once built, but can be left in the garden all winter when not in use.  To build remesh tomato cages, you’ll need one remesh sheet for each cage.  Four foot by seven foot remesh sheets with six inch square holes and can be purchased at home improvement stores along with tie wire (sold near the remesh).  You’ll need metal snips to cut the tie wire, and work gloves to protect your hands.  Bend remesh into a cylinder and slip the free ends of the mesh into the second column of holes in the adjoining side.  Lay the cylinder on its side with the seam side up, and use the tie wire to lash the free ends of the remesh to the wire it overlays.  Place cages over tomatoes at planting time.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Growing from Seed</title>
 <link>http://www.completelyeco.com/articles/growing-seed</link>
 <description>
&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is that saying about March…something about a lion?  This year, March is slinking in to the mid-Atlantic like a pussy cat, and as the thermometer consistently tops 60 degrees, gardeners are emerging from hibernation to ready their spaces for planting, perhaps a few weeks earlier than usual.  Peas, potatoes, and spinach can go in the ground mid-month, but the wise gardener will bide her time for a few more weeks to avoid losing other tender seedlings to late winter cold snaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are familiar with the process of growing plants from seedlings: buy baby plant, place baby plant in ground or pot, dose regularly with water, sunlight, love.  Growing from seed is a slightly different story.  Some seeds prefer to be planted directly in the ground (roots, beans, peas), while others need to be grown to a transplantable size in the comfort of a greenhouse or light table (the slow-pokes: cabbages, broccoli, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant), still others can swing either way (lettuces, kale, squash).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shame in buying your seedlings--but as with most things of worth, the best transplants are those grown locally.  Many farmers sell veggie seedlings at the market alongside their spring crops.  These will be better adapted to regional disease and pest pressures than those grown in mysterious, faraway greenhouses.  Growing your own seedlings, on the other hand, requires a bit of infrastructure, but it is a galvanizing gardening experience.  Use seedling trays, or improvise with egg cartons or yogurt cups--just be sure to poke some drainage holes.  Use a good quality potting soil—perhaps one that is specifically for seed starting.  The fine texture of these specialty mixes will ensure that there is good contact between the seeds and the moist substrate.  Fill your chosen containers with pre-moistened potting soil: unless it includes a wetting agent, many potting mixes are naturally hydrophobic and need coaxing to soak up water.  Top watering dry mix will just let water run through to the drainage holes.   So remember your best mud pie recipe, dump your mix in a plastic bin, add water, and work it in with your hands or a trowel until it is evenly moist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consult seed packets for timing and depth information.  Always err on the side of planting shallow rather than deep; a seed planted too deeply will likely sprout, but run out of stored energy before reaching the surface, where it can start harvesting sunlight for energy.  For small seeded plants, the depth will be ¼-1/2 inch—really nothing more than a tiny dimple in the surface of your soil.  Drop in two seeds (three if your seeds are old).  Since germination is always less than 100%, adding an extra seed will ensure that you get at least one sprout, rather than sacrificing the space to a dud.  You’ll need to thin to one seedling per planting cell after seedlings are a few inches tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little moisture and warmth is all that&#039;s needed to bring on germination.  Seedling mats, which heat trays from the bottom, can improve germination, but covering your trays with plastic to seal in moisture and placing on top of the fridge can have a similar effect (don’t try this with lettuces, which need light in order to germinate).  Check daily: once you see sprouts, your newly hatched babies will need plenty of light to keep the party going.  A south-facing window can do the job, but you&#039;ll have stronger, stouter seedlings if you grow them under florescent lights, hung right on top of them (seriously, right on top: 2 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feed seedlings with a diluted liquid fertilizer once a week or so.  Fish and kelp emulsions are readily available organic—albeit stinky—fertilizers appropriate for seedlings.  Follow package directions for dilution ratios.  Check moisture daily, but it’s okay to let the surface of the soil dry between waterings—this will promote strong root growth and discourage fungal growth.  Other than that, just be sure to talk to them in a sweet voice and play classical music when you’re away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before they head for the great outdoors, toughen your seedlings up for a week or so by treating them to increasing daily doses of outdoor sun and wind.  If you’re about the house, you can arrange a series of field trips outside, increasing in length each day.  If you’re out workin’ like a dog, put them out in different locations each morning, starting with least exposed part of your yard, and gradually moving them out into full sun and wind.  Bring them in each night, especially if the weather calls for freezing temps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnessing the transformation of a seed into a mature plant is a tiny spring miracle.  Urban Farmhouse works with clients to help them witness this seasonal magic, and turn it into honest food.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;, or contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; for information on our edible landscaping and gardening education services.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it: before the turn of the millennium, you may have used the word ‘local’ to differentiate between bus routes, to indicate a library branch or school, or to describe the proximity of a business.  But say the word now and your mind immediate jumps to the origin of your food.  Concern over the ecological and social implications of the source of our food have progressed from an elitist trend to a social norm—in fact, “locavore” was the Oxford American Dictionary word of the year in 2007.  Since then, we have seen a progressive expansion in the number of farmers markets and in the variety of foods available there; grocery stores regularly  highlight items from local farms, and a restaurant isn’t worth their salt if they aren’t showcasing local heirloom tomatoes on August menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our desire to procure food from friendly, familiar farmers grows, so does our interest in getting some of our food from the most local source there is: our back yards, porches, and balconies.  Growing some of your own food is a journey that nurtures an intimate connection with your food, supplements food budgets, and further informs a healthy critique of industrial farming practices.  However, the rise in interest in food gardening has re-emerged in a world that is drastically different from the nostalgic image of a 1950s backyard harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this:  in 1975, 49% of households had vegetable gardens.  This number dropped to a low in 1998, when only 24% of households grew some of their own food.  However, food gardening is back on the rise: in 2009, 37% of households had vegetable gardens, and annual consumer spending on fruit, vegetable, and herb gardening surpassed spending on ornamental flowers, shrubs, and trees.  While this is encouraging, we can’t ignore how lifestyles have changed in the last 35 years: in 1975, only 33% of households with children had two working adults, compared to 58% in 2009.  Vegetable gardens are re-emerging into a world that has less time to dedicate to gardening, and are being tended by folks who may not have grown up with a garden to learn from.  Add to that the tough economic times, and the pressure to make sure the time and space dedicated to the garden yields output is higher than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fortunate to work as a gardening and food educator in Baltimore City for the past six years, developing gardens, teaching cooking skills, and promoting good nutrition in schools, recreation centers, and senior centers throughout the area.  In my work in the community, I have thrilled at the enthusiasm of those who have discovered the allure of homegrown food, and cringed when they excitedly tell me they planted their beans in March.  I’ve marveled at the beautiful tomatoes that proud new gardeners have shown me, but longed that they might also grow carrots, okra, and sweet potatoes.  From these interactions and experiences, Urban Farmhouse was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Farmhouse (UF) is dedicated to helping homeowners and small businesses plan, install, maintain, and prepare healthy fruits, vegetables, and herbs on urban and suburban properties.  Through consultation, planning, installation, and maintenance, UF helps folks make the most of their gardening efforts, and reap all of the delicious rewards, so that they might continue to garden for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Urban Farmhouse uses a different service model than traditional landscaping outfits: typical UF clients want to connect with the gardening process; therefore, they DON’T want someone to show up, plant the garden, and disappear (although we’ll do that if you want).  Our clients want to learn and grow with their plants; we work to fill in the knowledge and skill gaps to help them be successful.  As such, our services are based around client education, and creating custom service packages that provide the clients with what the information and services they need while still allowing them the freedom to engage in the great gardening experiment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic consultations include a visit to your property, a soil test, advice on the best place to locate your garden, and a follow up summary of the best plants for your site.  Clients can then choose to purchase a custom garden plan, which includes a garden design, a three-season planting plan, a calendar of gardening tasks, and a narrative describing the whole process.  Many of our clients take it from there, while others discover that they’d rather have us install their garden.  If needed, we return for garden coaching sessions, or we provide season-long maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to be making regular contributions to CompletelyEco.com.  Each month I’ll share information and tips that will help you grow as a gardener and a local eater.  In the meantime, start thinking about your spring garden…and if you find yourself wondering how far to space your radish seeds, the best way to trellis peas, or when to plant your eggplant, contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; to schedule a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
