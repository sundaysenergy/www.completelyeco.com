 <title>Improving the Quality of School Lunches</title>

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t really matter that the sun hasn’t made its way to past the Earth’s equator yet to announce that fall is officially here. We celebrated Labor Day, which means that pools are closing and schools are opening. As we all know, that’s the official end to summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For parents, we can put away our summer reading books and say good-bye to carefree summer nights. Our energies now have to go into preparing for the next day’s activities. And, making those kid’s lunches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what productivity app we’re using, our lives get busier and more complicated all the time, and meal prep can be challenging. Sometimes, we even take short cuts. We’ll toss in those little prepackaged things those nice billion dollar food companies give us and probably advertise on TV so it’s top of mind when we’re grocery shopping or getting those lunch boxes ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ve personally spent hundreds of hours observing parents in grocery stores the last few months while I was handing out samples of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmoreorganic.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;B’more Organic&lt;/a&gt; skyr smoothies. I watched what goes into those grocery baskets. I’ve seen a lot faux health products and nicely packed, ready-to-eat foods tossed in those carts by well-meaning parents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, our own kids turned two and started demanding snacks. Initially, we reached for those handy little “fish” and put them in sandwich bags like our parents did for us. Of course they devoured the hydrogenated oil and sodium pills! Then, I tried an experiment and tossed raw cashews in a bag. They devoured them equally as fast. The kids even asked for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that taught me was that most big food companies will either remind you through ads about their product or make it easier to eat. (Though I do see that changing finally.) And, we’re often fooled about what’s really healthy, like those “yogurts” in those cool cartons with cool cartoons on them. Most are really sugar tubes with a dash of yogurt. Look at the backs of those containers. Put them down if you can’t pronounce what’s in it, there are more ingredients are more than you have fingers, or if there’s more sugar than protein. Real yogurt shouldn’t have too much sugar. And, I’ve personally witnessed it hundreds of times: kids will eat real yogurt. There are no cartoons characters on our packages, but kids love our &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmoreorganic.com/index.php/what-is-skyr/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;skyr smoothies&lt;/a&gt; when we hand it to them in a generic cup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even organic yogurt products can contain way too much sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I would encourage parents to 1) use a little creativity when packing lunches and replace unhealthy snacks with better choices like we did with the cashew nuts.  And, 2) read the back of the box for sugar and 3) give foods that are as close as to they are grown. Remember, fresh fruit has neat little packaging too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try some of these tricks this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Buy plain yogurt and add a tiny amount of natural sweeter (honey or stevia) and put it a Tupperware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Make a surprise bag with a different healthy choice every day. Some of mine include: raw pistachios, raw pumpkin seeds, peanut butter on dates, and grapes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Get rid of those bottled sugared drinks! Try putting water, stevia, and lemon juice in a reusable bottle; it tastes like lemonade with zero sugar or chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing is to be creative. Healthy eating can be fun and easy if you think ahead. As we say at B’more Organic: let’s B’more healthy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was written for completelyeco.com from Andrew Buerger of B&#039;More Organic. B&#039;More Organic is an organic food company based on skyr, an Icelandic style yogurt. Our foundation is based on local, family-owned and operated sustainable farming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We translated our passion for healthy living, fundraising, and environmental stewardship into a business selling easy to consume, great-tasting organic foods that are the perfect proportion of protein to carbohydrates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Buerger&lt;br /&gt;
Founder, B’more Organic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see business as part of a community. We live and work among our neighbors. We use the communities’ resources -- fire, police, and trash pick up.  We use water and sewers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses have lot of burden’s placed upon them by governments, such as taxes and regulations, and they are facing tough issues like rising health care costs. We still believe businesses can help enhance our society as part of the solution to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable companies realize that they use precious resources -- clean water, oil, and air.  We also understand that we create externalities such as air pollution, waste, and carbon emissions all of which detract from our environment.  At B’more Organic, we think its our job to minimize these aspects because we want to live on a healthy planet. After all, our children breathe the air and drink the water that we harm.  We also understand basic economics: there’s a limited supply of natural resources: coal, oil, and fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B’more Organic’s milk come from a sustainable farm that has grass-fed, organically raised cows. We think its bad to inject cows with antibiotics; feed them grain; give them hormones; or have them eat grass treated with pesticides.  It may cost more, but people have come to realize that bad health costs more in the long run.  People call that being sustainable. We think it’s good for the planet. And, we think it’s good for business. People can taste the difference, and we’re providing the consumer what they want: a product that won’t harm them, our children, or our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Spring Wood farm where we get our milk and make our smoothies, they are so progressive and help us be better citizens in the community we do business. They are solar powered so we aren’t consuming natural resources other then the sun, and do less harm to the air when we make our product.  What I love also about the farmer is that he takes great care of his animals. I’m an animal nut. (My poor husband: I make him remove insects and place them gently outside.)  And we’ve found that happier cows make better tasting milk. Are we being socially responsible in being sustainable or just good business people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously our name is a play on words: we started in Baltimore (B’more to us locals) and we want people to be a little more “organic” every day. We understand that it’s a journey. We don’t want people to feel bad for where they are now, just encourage them improve over time. Our three core values are: B’more Giving, B’more Healthy and B’more Green. If we had to pick to give one piece advice to the next generation, I would say B’more giving.  We give 10% of our proceeds to Johns Hopkins breast cancer and MS research. But B’more Giving is not just a charitable concept. It’s B’more giving of your time, and B’more Giving of yourself. The world would be just a little better if we could all be just a little more giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating our company, we chose to stick to our core values. Many people said not to be organic, or to add preservatives, add sugar for American tastes, or not be so green, don’t give so much away to charity, but in the end, people can tell the difference. And we didn’t compromise one inch. Is this sustainability? Yes, and we think it’s just about being a good neighbor, and making a community we’d want to live in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created B’more Organic protein smoothies because we felt like there was nothing on the market that met our needs. Most products had too much sugar or not enough protein. Or they weren’t organic. We wanted something conveniently bottled that we could eat and feel comfortable giving to our babies.  That’s our test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like being organic, we think sustainability is something we strive for constant improvement.   For example, we hope to find affordable bottles made from recycled plastic. These are things that can be regulated or forced upon us.  We think it makes total business sense to us because consumers appreciate what we’re doing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a sustainable company is important to us.  What good is a creating wealth for ourselves if we can’t swim in our lakes or breath our air?  But, we know you can do both: maximize profit and minimize the damage to our plant. It just takes desire and creativity.  Start by being a little more organic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
