  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy of the future is here today; solar is more attainable and affordable than ever before.  There are federal, state, and local funding/ credits/ and incentives available, not to mention improved panel efficiency, and production practices that have brought the price of solar down to less than 1% of what it was back in the 1970’s when it first hit the main stream market.&lt;br /&gt;
However, even with all of the advancements and monies available, many homeowners are still unable to stomach the large up-front cost of installing their solar electric system, and have instead turned to the newest program on the block: the power purchase agreement (PPA) or solar lease.  Both programs are very similar, but with distinct differences:&lt;br /&gt;
A power purchase agreement (PPA) means that you pay a fixed rate for the electricity your panels produce.  You only pay for the electricity your system produces each month, as opposed to a solar lease where you pay a fixed amount every month for your solar panels, regardless of how much energy those panels produce.&lt;br /&gt;
So what does this mean?  Each company is set up slightly differently, but here are the basics&lt;br /&gt;
	•	You don’t own the equipment so you don’t have to pay for it, its installation, monitoring, or repairs, and depending on the terms of the lease, have little to no up-front costs.  It is similar to renting an apartment: you pay a monthly fee to live there, but don’t have to worry about a large upfront down payment, and when something goes wrong the land lord is there to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Depending on the company you go with for your project, at the end of your leases duration some companies give you the options to purchase your system at FMV (fair market value).&lt;br /&gt;
	•	If you sell your home it is easy to transfer  the lease to the new owners&lt;br /&gt;
Leasing and PPA agencies partner with local, trusted installers with proven reputations and ability.  In the Mid-Atlantic area, &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenspringenergy.com&quot;&gt;Greenspring Energy&lt;/a&gt; is one of those trusted installers, which has partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sunrunhome.com&quot;&gt;SunRun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.sunpowercorp.com&quot;&gt;SunPower&lt;/a&gt; (NJ only).&lt;br /&gt;
With so many payment and financing options available, solar is worth another look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;serif field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Paul Wittemann started a solar electric, and energy efficiency company that he named: “Greenspring Energy.”  Now four years later in 2011, that little start-up has landed on the Inc. 500 list of America’s fastest growing companies at number 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it all started….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with moving across the country to Colorado for the EcoStar Corporation, Paul Wittemann, now CEO of Greenspring Energy, decided to leave his job and start his own company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What sealed the deal for me,” explains Wittemann, “was when I called around to Baltimore/Washington area solar contractors and no one returned my calls.  That’s when I thought ‘I can do better, I have to do better.’”  From then on Wittemann set out to start a company that focused on the customer, not the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittemann started with $50,000 in savings, an “executive office” he found on Craig’s List for $500 a month in Towson, MD; and got to work getting certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spent the first 6 months in training, learning about the industry, and figuring out what brands I should offer.”  The new entrepreneur was working 6 and 7 days a week, doing everything from getting certified to creating marketing materials.  In October 2007 it all paid off with his first big month; installing 4 systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there the company grew quickly, adding a Pennsylvania branch in Reading in 2008, and in 2011 expanding down to Charlotte, North Carolina.  What started as one man in cubical, in four years has grown to 57 employees in three different branches across the mid-Atlantic… a growth of 8,700 percent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Greenspring difference….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason we have been successful is because we’re different,” said Wittemann, “we don’t just sell you a solar electric system; we become your solar partner for life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Greenspring is committed to selling only the highest quality brands, with the best warranties, and most dependable product lines.  Partnering with such distinguished names as “Schuco,” “Solar World,” and “LG” give Greenspring and its customers the confidence that comes from knowing their system was constructed with the most technologically advanced and responsible methods available on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anyone can sell a solar electric system,” said Larry Chaput, sales director of Greenspring, “we are selling an energy solution, combining solar and efficiency, specifically tailored for each customer to lessen their dependence on the utility companies and those ever increasing rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Greenspring has believed the best way to accomplish that is a “marriage” of solar electric and energy efficiency products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We create systems designed to “produce and reduce” if you will,” said Chaput, “as the most effective and environmentally friendly means of getting consumer’s utilities bills as close to $0 as possible.”&lt;br /&gt;
To do this Greenspring has put together a team of energy auditors who exist to teach customers ways they can improve their homes energy consumption; saving the owner’s money and reducing their environmental impact all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we go out to a home for a free site evaluation, we always suggest a Home Energy Audit.  It’s not enough to just start producing energy; people need to learn steps they can take to make their home more efficient as well,” says Wittemann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Difference for Consumers….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar by itself is a wise investment, but Greenspring Energy’s unique combination of solar and energy efficiency take return on investment to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With all the great tax incentives, both state and federal, available for people going solar, combined with our packages of solar and efficiency, many of our customers see their system has paid for itself in as little as 3 to 5 years,” said Wittemann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners are not the only demographic catered to by Greenspring.  Many small businesses are also taking advantage of the savings from solar.&lt;br /&gt;
“It [solar] really is the coolest thing,” says area sales manager Frank Sullivan.  “I have this guy in Baltimore who owns a Driver’s Ed school.  He wants to do a full solar array on the roof to feed to a charging station for the 2 electric cars he just bought for his students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,300 solar installs to date, and four years of experience creating custom energy solutions for its customers, Greenspring is a company you can count on to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes we have expanded and grown and that’s great,” says Wittemann. “Do I think someday we might be a nationwide company?  Maybe.  But right now we are really just focused on being the best.”  That, it would seem, is the REAL Greenspring Energy difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
