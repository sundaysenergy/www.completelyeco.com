  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto: farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As summer fades, so go the tender summer fruits.  Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant will produce until first frost, but they are slower to ripen, and the weary plants produce fruit that tells of the approaching end of the season, with thicker skins, and smaller size.  So we transition back to eating plants that thrive in cool weather--salad greens, hardy winter cooking greens, carrots, beets, turnips and radishes--but in the fall, we add to that hard veggies born in summer but maturing in fall, including winter squash, sweet potatoes, and late crop potatoes, with sturdy skins and hard flesh that have the staying power to last into winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that in eras gone by, folks lasted an entire winter on produce put up from the growing season is mystifying—surviving winter’s doldrums even without the concern of limited access to produce can be a challenge for modern sorts.  So how was winter nourishment accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canning may be the most commonly recognized method of putting up produce; canned vegetables and fruits require no refrigeration, removing one of the main limiting factors to bulk long-term storage.  However, canning is a fairly energy and equipment intensive, and food safety requires the addition of acid, salt, or sugar to most produce to prevent microbial growth—which zaps nutrition and changes the flavor of the fresh product.  Tomatoes are the ideal can-didate: with a low pH, they need no chemical modifications to stay food safe.  If you haven’t done it yet this season, can ‘em soon, and can ‘em good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more back-to-basics approach, one that might not get you through the entire winter but can keep you eating local (with occasional imported indulgences) for several months, is to cellar roots and other hard-fleshed winter vegetables.  Root cellars used to be standard issue in the outfitting of a home.  They were small rooms in the basement or built into a nearby hillside that provided hard vegetables with what they need to stay their best: darkness, constant humidity, air circulation, and cool temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your commitment to locavorism ends at the point that requires a basement renovation for inanimate winter residents, you can create similar conditions using only a large box and some sawdust or peat to insulate.  When the market is flush with them, buy a large supply of potatoes, carrots, onions, and winter squash.  If the veg is coming from your garden, harvest after a few dry days, and allow the roots to dry in the sun for a day or two.  You can rub off some of the dirt, but be careful not to nick the protective skin, and don’t wash before storage—wet skins breed rot.  Put a layer of sawdust or peat in your box, and lay down a layer of veggies, spaced close together but not touching.  Add another layer of bedding and repeat until all veggies are stored, covering with a final layer of bedding, and covering the box with a lid or flaps.  You may want to consider creating mixed veggie layers, so that retrieving a carrot doesn’t require digging through layers of potatoes, turnips, and winter squash to find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A constant temperature of around 34 degrees is ideal, but warmer is okay as long as the fluctuations are minimal—it’s the rise and fall of temperatures that signal root vegetables to break dormancy and sprout, the beginning of the end for the edibility of said root.  So place the box in the coolest place you have—the basement, the garage, the carport.  The layers of sawdust will insulate against drastic temperature fluctuations.  When you retrieve veggies for use, check for and cull any that are showing signs of rot, which can spread to others in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep your winter local diet lively, be sure you’re storing other flavors as well: now is a great time to cut and dry herbs such as rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage.  Pruning stimulates new growth, so you want to cut a few weeks before first frost to give new shoots a chance to grow and toughen up, avoiding frost damage.  While dried herbs do feel like a sorry substitute after a season of enjoying them fresh, you may be surprised at the intensity of flavor in your home-dried herbs: those purchased from commercial suppliers are of indeterminate age, and have often lost potency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you dig in to winter vegetables, use those roots and winter squash for all they’re worth: starchy, creamy flesh, when cooked soft, purees to create silky soups; their natural sugars caramelize beautifully when roasted; and shredded roots, tossed with herbs, aromatics, a beaten egg and some flour, produce wicked-good savory pancakes.  Now that doesn’t sound too much like suffering, does it?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September is a time for gardeners to luxuriate in the bounty resulting from their hard work. Sure, weeds still need weeding, and water still needs sprinkling, but much less so than in deep summer.  Spring, summer, and fall planting are done, but the time to put things to rest is still weeks away.  In the meantime, the harvest pours in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we hang in the balance between spring set up and autumn break down, take a moment to assess the season.  Look at your harvest basket.  What were your greatest returns on investment?  What would it have cost you at the grocery store?  What did you learn?  What will you do differently next year?  What varieties were highlights, and which will you gratefully trade out for something new next year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A food garden is an investment similar to a home: in the beginning, you devote a significant amount of time, money, and labor as beds are built, soil is amended, paths are laid.  After installation, inputs follow a seasonal cycle of spring investment and fall returns.  But unlike a house, whose long-term value is primarily influenced by the whims of the market, a garden’s value can continue to increase each year whilst your annual expenses decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But notice we said a garden’s value can continue to increase.  The key to ensuring your time and money remain a sound investment is to become a student of your garden. Thomas Jefferson is quoted as saying, &quot;Though an old man, I am but a young gardener.&quot; Each season is a single lesson in a lifelong curriculum.  But by taking careful notice, and yes, studious notes, we can ensure that the garden appreciates each year.  So as you savor a late summer caprese salad, make like a college freshman and take some notes: record successes and challenges, notes on varieties, pests, spacing, diseases, weeds—do it now, while the plants are at full size and telling their story (it’s so easy to forget the bad seeds in spring’s hopefulness!).  Snap a few pictures while you&#039;re at it. And--here&#039;s the key--look at your notes next winter as you plan for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a single item on your garden budget that’s always a good investment, it’s your soil.  A thriving soil ecosystem includes a diverse community of bacteria, fungi, annelids, and arthropods—your allies in transforming organic matter into nutrients your plants can use, and creating a resilient garden that doesn’t crumble under isolated disease and pest outbreaks.  As fall approaches, the natural world shifts gears from biomass production to senescence and decomposition, providing an opportunity to take advantage of this natural cycle: Fall is a great time to feed your soil; amending your soil with compost in the fall will give it time to incorporate and its nutrients to become bioavailable for spring plantings.  All that organic matter falling from the sky is also available to build your first compost pile, use as mulch, or dig into your soil to compost in place.  To learn more about fall soil stewardship, join Urban Farmhouse for a workshop at Roland Park Country School on Tuesday, October 9th at 6:30 pm.  See page three of the course catalogue for details and registration, or email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we sign off, an illustrative example: The Urban Farmhouse test garden took three seasons to establish, including beds, fruit trees and shrubs, hardscaping, composter, and a wash station, but by the fourth season, we spent only about $100 on the garden, mostly on seeds. And since late April, we&#039;ve been cooing over radishes, leeks, artichokes, tomatoes, peaches, raspberries, beets, carrots, scallions, garlic...(we could go on). From hear on out, we&#039;re in the black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- THIS SHOULD BE FOR JUST THE BODY --&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chrissa Carlson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;farmer@urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&quot;&gt;www.urbanfarmhouseonline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for the most dedicated local eaters, there are some harsh realities to locavorism.  By early June, the sun is warm, the earth is vibrantly green, and the garden is thriving.  But even though the time seems ripe to add thick, smooth-fleshed slices of homegrown tomato to the supper table, without the help of season extending hoop houses, we are weeks from harvesting fruiting crops. CSA members often share a common story of their enthusiasm at receiving the first several leafy green shares quickly giving way to hidden chagrin at the brimming, and seemingly endless, bags of chard, kale, lettuces, and mustards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produce seasonality follows the life-cycle of annual plants: seeds sprout, sending roots earthward searching for water and nutrients, and stems skyward seeking the sun.  Leaves unfold to collect solar energy, and once the plant has developed enough leafy surface area to fuel its exploits, the plant becomes sexually mature: flowers form, developing into fruit, packed with seeds of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So goes the locavore’s annual menu cycle: the earliest arrivals to our table are fast growing roots (e.g., radishes), stems (asparagus) and leaves.  Lots and lots of leaves.  Soon come the precocious peas, the fastest annual vegetable to produce offspring.  The slower developing roots (potatoes, carrots, beets) show up next, preceding the imminent arrival of the gods and goddesses of the vegetable patch: tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, eggplant…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s June, and while we obediently peruse the farmers market each week, waiting for the arrival of each new produce prize, all that beautiful greenery might be getting a little…dull.  But fear not! Greens add nutrition and life to many dishes, and different varieties can be interchanged in recipes with ease.  A few basics tips for your leafy green arsenal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Cooking time is the main variant in dealing with different types of leafies.  Young spring greens will cook more quickly than those available later in the summer and into the fall.  Collards and kale tend to be tougher than mustard greens, beet greens, or Swiss chard, and require slightly longer cooking times.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Stems of all leafy greens are edible, though they are often discarded due to their tougher texture.  To even the score, strip leaves from their stems, chop the stems fine, and start cooking them in advance of the leaves—throw them in with the onions and garlic, adding the leaves later.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Substitute Swiss chard in any recipe calling for cooked spinach.  Its flavor is almost identical, and it doesn’t reduce in the heat as much as spinach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond grandma’s cooked-all-day greens (and resolving to retain at least a smidge of their nutrition), greens can be added to soups, stirfries, curries, and pastas with reckless abandon, or used to make creative side and main dishes that stand on their own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	•	Marry sweet, savory, and vegetal flavors with an Italian chard sauté: Sauté onions and chopped chard stems in olive oil (or if you’re feeling naughty, bacon fat) until softened.  Add torn chard leaves, working in batches if needed and cook until wilted.  Add a handful or raisins and a splash of water.  Cook until raisins are plump, season with salt and pepper, and serve sprinkled with pine nuts and a dash of balsamic vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Create a beautifully simple raw kale salad: Strip washed kale from stems and chop fine.  Drizzle with olive oil and sea salt and massage kale until it softens and turns an emerald green, savoring the smell of the chlorophyll.  Toss with a little lemon juice and serve as is or topped with freshly grated Romano cheese or nutritional yeast.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Whip up a weeknight dinner with an any-greens frittata: Sauté onions and garlic in a heavy stovetop-to-oven worthy pan, such as cast iron.  Add washed, torn greens, and cook until wilted.  Pour scrambled, seasoned eggs over greens, and top with a cheese of your choice.  Cook over low heat on the stove top until beginning to set, then transfer to the oven and bake until top is set and cheese is melted and beginning to brown.&lt;br /&gt;
	•	Surprise your guests with a Swiss chard saag (Indian creamed spinach): Fill a pot with washed chard leaves, and add a cinnamon stick, some grated fresh ginger, and a chopped jalapeño, tomato, and small onion.  Cover and cook over medium heat until greens are very tender.  In a separate pan, sauté another chopped onion and some crushed garlic, then throw in generous, equal doses of ground cumin and coriander (about a tablespoon each).  Remove from heat.  Puree the greens in a blender or with an immersion blender (remember to remove the cinnamon stick), then stir in the spiced sautéed onions.  Season well with salt.  Seriously, it works!&lt;/p&gt;
